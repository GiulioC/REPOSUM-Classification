 Pride and virtue in the political thought of Jean-Jacques Rousseau	 Thévenon, Daniel	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2014	 This thesis examines the relationship between political virtue and moral virtue in the works of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. After critically engaging with Rousseau's compelling yet complex theory of human sociability, focusing more particularly on the seminal relationship between the two forms of self-love, the "natural" amour de soi and "social" amour-propre, it is observed that the culmination of Rousseau's moral theory in Emile sees him espouse a particular kind of moral excellence called vertu, defined as a striving to master one's passions, and a particular type of freedom named liberté morale, inherent in the act of obeying the inner law originating in man's conscience. After further exploring Rousseau's conception of vertu, and insisting upon the ambitiousness of his moral theory, the thesis argues that Rousseau's political theory differs from it in "taking men as they are", and starting from the assumption that men are driven by their passions. That the hegemony of amour-propre is pre-supposed by Rousseau's political project is demonstrated through a detailed comparison of the civic education described in his prescriptive political writings with the moral education advocated in Emile. Finally, it draws the implications of the discrepancies between Rousseau's moral and political versions of virtue for his political theory, identifying a strong tension between two ideals that have generally been regarded as wedded within it, those of republican liberty and moral freedom.

 Experimental practices of music and philosophy in John Cage and Gilles Deleuze	 Campbell, Iain	 Kingston University	 Kingston University	2015	 In this thesis we construct a critical encounter between the composer John Cage and the philosopher Gilles Deleuze. This encounter circulates through a constellation of problems found across and between mid-twentieth century musical, artistic, and philosophical practices, the central focus for our line of enquiry being the concept of experimentation. We emphasize the production of a method of experimentation through a practice historically situated with regards to the traditions of the respective fields of music and philosophy. However, we argue that these experimental practices are not reducible to their historical traditions, but rather, by adopting what we term a problematic reading, or transcendental critique, with regards to historical givens, they take their historical situation as the site of an experimental departure. We follow Cage through his relation to the history of Western classical music, his contemporaries in the musical avant-garde, and artistic movements surrounding and in some respects stemming from Cage’s work, and Deleuze through his relation to Kant, phenomenology, and structuralism, in order to map the production of a practice of experimentation spanning music, art, and philosophy. Some specific figures we engage with in these respective traditions include Jean-Phillipe Rameau, Pierre Schaeffer, Marcel Duchamp, Pierre Boulez, Robert Morris, Yoko Ono, La Monte Young, Edmund Husserl, Maurice-Merleau-Ponty, Alain Badiou, and Félix Guattari. In so doing we seek to find between these practices points of both conjunction and disjunction which enrich our understanding of Cage’s and Deleuze’s work, and, more widely speaking, of the passage of twentieth century music and philosophy in general. Here we hope to make contributions to the fields of continental philosophy and music theory especially, and to open a point of engagement with the nascent field of sound studies.

 Moral decisions, moral distress, and the psychological health of nurses	 Willis, Martin E. H.	 Loughborough University	 Loughborough University	2015	The major focus of this thesis is the role of feelings and emotions in moral thinking/knowing, ethical conduct and, in particular, moral distress in nursing. Research has consistently found that the moral decisions nurses must make can sometimes lead to distress. However, such experiences are overly individualised in the literature. An alternative view of the person, drawing on the philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead (e.g. 1927-8/1978) and the recent work of Paul Stenner (e.g. 2008), sees human subjectivity or mind as processual and always embodied and in-the-world. The emphasis upon the body draws attention to the role of felt experiences this thesis views feelings as integral to both sense-making knowing and thinking and sensibility or emotionality. The emphasis in-the-world highlights that subjectivity is embedded within social contexts, which include relations of power and organisations of material and symbolic capital aligned with those relations. Influenced by deep empiricism (e.g. Stenner, 2011a), this thesis develops a novel bricolage methodology based on a metaphor of diffraction to explore nurses experiences of moral distress. Nurses feelings of discomfort, a particular form of feelings of knowing , appear to be the seeds of moral distress. Various situations seem to be important antecedents for these seeds to bloom into full moral distress, including certain clinical issues, ethical conflict with colleagues, and issues of competency. Nurses also experience some aspects of their job as systemic barriers to high standards of care, which can also be morally distressing. Such distress sometimes affects nurses relationships, their physical health, and their mental health. Participants have found several strategies useful in coping with their distress. It is argued that these strategies are about altering one s feelings through changing one s activities and/or environment. Additionally, past distress may remain a dormant part of a person s subjectivity and re-emerge or become (re)enacted in the narrations of those past distressing experiences. It is suggested that subjectivity entails an organisation of past experiences in the present, for present purposes and in anticipation of the future. Six dominant thematic patternings, which recurred throughout the analyses, are discussed: (i) the centrality of feelings; (ii) the relationality of felt experiences; (iii) the complexity of morality, moral conduct, and moral distress moral/ethical issues become entangled with identity, power, professional competency, and social relations; (iv) the prominence of power and interest; (v) nurses' lives as afflicted by moral distress; and (vi) life-as-process. Discussion of these motifs leads to a rethinking of moral distress. Implications for nursing practice, moral distress research and the study of feelings, emotions, and affect are discussed.

 Aristotle's use of "genus" in logic, philosophy and science	 Carr, Jeffrey	 University of Edinburgh	 University of Edinburgh	1997	In Metaphysics Delta.28, Aristotle provides four uses of the term "genus", which he then summarises in three separate accounts. The purpose of this dissertation is first, to explain each of the uses given by Aristotle, second, to explain how his summary of the four uses by three accounts is justified, and third, to examine some philosophical applications of each use. I will relate the different uses to each other as far as entailments can be established, and show that the focal, if not the most common sense of genus, corresponds to the use of genus as the substratum of differentiate, given in Aristotle's summary as the view that the genus is the matter. In the role of substratum, the genus is fundamental to Aristotle's account of the unity of an organic substance and ground a profound metaphysics thesis: the proximate genus is a necessary constituent in the nature and persistence of material objects.

 Basic moral certainty and the foundations of morality	 O'Hara, Neil Martin	 University of Hertfordshire	 University of Hertfordshire	2017	I aim to show in this thesis that human beings are morally concerned to the core; that a concern for moral goodness is a necessary part of our humanity. Central to my account of the foundations of morality is what I call 'primary recognition', which I argue is the source of our moral thinking. By primary recognition, I mean our basic apprehension of other human beings as objects of some moral concern. I take this to be a 'basic moral certainty', in accord with the notion recently introduced by Nigel Pleasants in the debate on moral foundations, which he drew from the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein on the notion of basic empirical certainty, found in On Certainty (1969). Building on Pleasants' notion of 'basic moral certainty' I bring to bear Danièle Moyal-Sharrock's distinction between universal and local forms of basic certainty in an effort to make sense of the co-existence of universal moral beliefs and local, often conflicting, moral beliefs. I offer and defend two examples of universal basic moral certainties: 'At least some killings are wrong' and 'Some wrongs are more serious, more wrong, than others', which I take to be necessarily indubitable for any moral agent. I then examine examples of local moral certainties: the wrongness of pig sacrifice in ancient Judaism, the goodness of hospitality among the modern Pashtun, and the wrongness of cannibalism for the ancient Greeks. These examinations lead me to conclude that basic moral certainties come in both local and universal varieties in just the same way as basic empirical certainties, and that holding certain local moral beliefs is definitional for membership in certain epistemic communities. I go on to consider some challenges to the view that morality has its foundations in basic moral certainty, in particular that made by G.E.M Anscombe and Alasdair MacIntyre that modern moral thought lacks any foundations. I reply by reiterating the nonrational nature of the foundations of morality, modern or otherwise. I conclude the thesis by outlining some of the outcomes of this account of moral certainty for contemporary moral philosophy.

 Squaring Paul Tillich's ecclesiological circle	 Knight, Barbara	 University of Chichester	 University of Southampton	2009	The thesis presents the hypothesis that the systematic theology of Paul Tillich (1886-1965) offers significant new benefits towards church unity. The methodology used in pursuit of this aim, is a critical analysis of Tillich's early and late thought. Tillich' s work was influenced by the German philosophical and theological schools and came to expression in American academia in his publication Systematic Theology. The results of this analysis reveal Tillich's consistent commitment to the concept of Gestalt. This finding has been broadened to include the concept that the strength of ecclesial unity is dependent upon the understanding that every ecclesial denomination is an effective element in the constituency of the whole Church. This argument is supported by a deconstruction of Tillich' s system that is keyed into the hermeneutical theories of Gadamer and Derrida. The system is then reconstructed in terms of a new Gestalt that turns on the hypothesis that there is a relationship of synthesis between philosophy and theology within the Tillichian system, rather than the complementary relationship that Tillich claims. This conclusion is based upon the system being perceived as being founded upon the Western classical philosophical and theological traditions. A critique of Tillich's incorporation of modern existential hermeneutics into this system is made principally in relation to the existentialist thought of Kierkegaard, Heidegger and Sartre. A hermeneutic of Tillich' s existential critique serves to highlight the questions that result from existential disruption rather than to label him as an existentialist per se. The system is thus moved forward into the post-modern context under new hermeneutics. An analysis of Tillich's ecclesiology reveals that this is both eschatological and Trinitarian in nature. The relationship between Tillich's system and ecclesiology is brought into dialogue by means of their being expressed in terms of an ecclesiological circle. These hermeneutics are compared and contrasted with the ecclesiologies of Zizioulas and Haight and the published ecumenical documents of The World Council of Churches in order to reveal their commonalties. When the system has thus been applied to the current ecumenical dialogue, then it becomes apparent that the raison d'etre of Tillich's system is the Church and the raison d'etre of the Church is the system. The squaring of Paul Tillich's ecclesiological circle is thus made complete.	 Thesis or dissertation	 B Philosophy (General) ; BV Practical Theology	507152	1

 A study of the doctrine of evil and theodicy in the theology of Karl Barth	 Rodin, Robert Scott	 University of Aberdeen	 University of Aberdeen	1993	This study seeks: 1) to demonstrate that there are four dominant motifs in Barth's theology which provide essential insight for a proper understanding of his doctrine of evil, 2) to prove the centrality and trace the development of these motifs, 3) to analyse each motif for its strengths and weaknesses and develop a critique of Barth's doctrine of evil, and 4) to construct from his doctrine of evil a 'Barthian theodicy' with implications for preaching, counselling and Christian ethics. These motifs are: 1) the 'Necessary Antithesis' between evil and God's eternal plan for creation; 2) the 'Right and Left Hand of God' where evil is permitted and granted its power and role according to God's non-willing; 3) Barth's 'Noetic Eschatology' in which the completion of the redemption of humanity at the final	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	241434	1

 Speaking politically, not politics : an Adornian study of 'apolitical' twentieth-century fiction	 Philippou, Eleni	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2015	My thesis is concerned with Theodor Adorno (1903-1969), the Frankfurt School theorist, and the implications of his philosophy for literary studies. I show that Adorno's thought may offer a valid contribution to the analysis of literary texts, even texts with which he is not historically associated. More specifically, I link Adorno with texts that emerge out of situations of political extremity but are not necessarily understood as "political" protest literature. Drawing on a variety of Adorno's texts, I assert that key concepts within Adorno's thought - truth content, immanence, the non-identical - allow us a way of understanding literary texts that appear apolitical, but in fact are speaking to the social and material relations of their specific (political) context. Adorno's exposition on the interface between the artwork and history usefully engages authors that problematise or dismantle our traditional conception of what constitutes the "political" - overt manifest content that aligns itself with a particular ideological position. I have chosen three twentieth-century authors (J.M. Coetzee; Margarita Karapanou; Michael Ondaatje) whose literature bear the burden of political extremity (respectively, South African apartheid, the 1970s Greek military junta, and the Sri Lankan civil war), and is at loggerheads with the literature of political commitment emerging from each of those situations. Each of these authors asserts his or her aesthetic autonomy over prescriptive understandings of literature as a vehicle actively espousing a particular nationalist, political, ideological or even aesthetically formalist position. The work of these authors, I argue, embodies an alternative Adornian version of engaged literature. In short, my thesis operates as a two way conversation asking: "What can Adorno's concepts give to certain literary texts?", and reciprocally, "What can those texts give to our traditional understanding of Adorno and his applicability?" This thesis is an act of rethinking the literary in Adornian terms, and rethinking Adorno through the literary.

 Complementary and alternative medicine : ethics, legality, and use of the best available science	 Seip, Robert	 Cardiff University	 Cardiff University	2015	The purpose of this thesis is to provide a robust epistemological justification for Evidence Based Medicine (EMB), and thereby to demonstrate the epistemological short comings of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM). CAM has received support from both philosophers, such as Rorty and Feyerband, and the Sociology and Anthropology of Medicine. The thesis will thus review both the internal coherence and the application of non-realist arguments, and counter non-realism with the realist epistemology and philosophy of science that is represented by C.S. Peirce’s pragmatism. Rorty and Feyerabend and others have developed radical forms of scientific antirealism in the latter 20th century. Subsequently, sociologists developed even more intractable forms of anti-realism, which they applied to the social study of science. This approach served to challenge the legitimacy of orthodox scientific practice (including EMB). A practical expression of this controversy was immediately identified in the question of the role of scientific authority in a democratic society. That question was immediately applied to the status of alternative medical systems and their legitimacy vis-a-vis EBM in terms of the controversy over what has come to be termed "medical pluralism": If scientific medicine has no particular authority, should other, medical systems, epistemically incompatible with EBM, be made available as well? The thesis will suggest that non-realism is in fact a marginal position within the philosophy of science. Scientists, medical researchers and medical practitioners may thus appeal to the philosophy of science in order to justify their authority in the face of challenges from CAM. However, it will be suggested that they are frequently ill-served by a reliance on a simplistic understanding of the philosophy of Karl Popper. An alternative will be proposed in the philosophy of C. S. Peirce. His pragmatism offers to medical research and medical practice a way of understanding and justifying the scientific process, a justification of realism in the face of non-realism, and a resource for the criticism of CAM and medical pluralism, as at once epistemologically ill grounded and potentially dangerous to patients and the general public.

 Nominalist's credo	 Collin, James Henry	 University of Edinburgh	 University of Edinburgh	2013	Introduction: I lay out the broad contours of my thesis: a defence of mathematical nominalism, and nominalism more generally. I discuss the possibility of metaphysics, and the relationship of nominalism to naturalism and pragmatism. Chapter 2: I delineate an account of abstractness. I then provide counter-arguments to claims that mathematical objects make a di erence to the concrete world, and claim that mathematical objects are abstract in the sense delineated. Chapter 3: I argue that the epistemological problem with abstract objects is not best understood as an incompatibility with a causal theory of knowledge, or as an inability to explain the reliability of our mathematical beliefs, but resides in the epistemic luck that would infect any belief about abstract objects. To this end, I develop an account of epistemic luck that can account for cases of belief in necessary truths and apply it to the mathematical case. Chapter 4: I consider objections, based on (meta)metaphysical considerations and linguistic data, to the view that the existential quantifier expresses existence. I argue that these considerations can be accommodated by an existentially committing quantifier when the pragmatics of quantified sentences are properly understood. I develop a semi-formal framework within which we can define a notion of nominalistic adequacy. I show how our notion of nominalistic adequacy can show why it is legitimate for the nominalist to make use of platonistic “assumptions” in inference-making. Chapter 5: I turn to the application of mathematics in science, including explanatory applications, and its relation to a number of indispensability arguments. I consider also issues of realism and anti-realism, and their relation to these arguments. I argue that abstraction away from pragmatic considerations has acted to skew the debate, and has obscured possibilities for a nominalistic understanding of mathematical practices. I end by explaining the notion of a pragmatic meta-vocabulary, and argue that this notion can be used to carve out a new way of locating our ontological commitments. Chapter 6: I show how the apparatus developed in earlier chapters can be utilised to roll out the nominalist project to other domains of discourse. In particular, I consider propositions and types. I claim that a unified account of nominalism across these domains is available. Conclusion: I recapitulate the claims of my thesis. I suggest that the goal of mathematical enquiry is not descriptive knowledge, but understanding.

 A study of Hegel's conception of progress	 Sadock, Margaret A.	 University of Aberdeen	 University of Aberdeen	1996	 The overall aim of this thesis is to critically evaluate the development of the idea of progress in Hegel's philosophy. A general examination of the idea of progress was required to fully explicate Hegel's own treatment of this idea. The emergence of the idea of progress in the Early Theological Writings was then discussed. The discussion of these writings served to clarify Hegel's mature conception of the idea of progress. Hegel's treatment of the idea of progress in the Phenomenology of Spirit was then investigated. This investigation led into a discussion of how Hegel viewed the relation between philosophy and history. Several interpretations of the Phenomenology were then examined in order to further elucidate this text. Some of the difficulties associated with the adoption of a Hegelian view of history were highlighted by examining Francis Fukuyama's formulation of a contemporary Hegelian interpretation of history. Hegel's most complete discussion of the idea of progress is to be found in the Lectures on the Philosophy of World History. These lectures were used both to define Hegel's mature vision of the philosophy of history and to examine the moral implications of looking upon history from a philosophical viewpoint.

 Humanity, virtue, justice : a framework for a capability approach	 Bessey, Benjamin James	 University of Birmingham	 University of Birmingham	2015	 This Thesis reconsiders the prospects for an approach to global justice centring on the proposal that every human being should possess a certain bundle of goods, which would include certain members of a distinctive category: the category of capabilities. My overall aim is to present a clarified and well-developed framework, within which such claims can be made. To do this, I visit a number of regions of normative and metanormative theorising. I begin by introducing the motivations for the capability approach, and clarifying some of its most distinctive features. Next, I focus on Martha Nussbaum's version of the approach, and identify several problems therein. The most important concerns epistemology, and especially the challenges that constructivist theories pose. The middle part of the Thesis presents an alternative, based on the work of John McDowell, which I argue has superior prospects. Then, I turn to two further problems: that of making sense of the universalistic aspirations of cosmopolitanism, and that of integrating the microscopic prescriptions of ethics with the macroscopic analyses of political philosophy. Using the Aristotelian interpretation of its core framework that I have developed, I conclude that the capability approach can provide compelling answers to important questions about global justice.

 Musical improvisation as the place where being speaks : Heidegger, language and sources of Christian hope	 Love, Andrew Lawrence	 University of Hull	 University of Hull	2000	The thesis enters several under-examined areas. First, improvisatory music will be considered as a human phenomenon in the widest sense (Chapter 1 ), and a phenomenon destined to suffer relative decline in the cultural environment of the modern West (Chapter 2). In consequence, the language in which improvisatory music is now discussed in the West will be shown to carry a negative charge (Chapter 3). Among various philosophies of music in the Western tradition, none appears to have foregrounded improvisatory music specifically. However Heidegger's philosophy, it will be suggested, harbours inner trends which favour the idea of music as a central component in philosophical discourse (Chapter 4) and may be used as a starting point for a re-emergent understanding of musical improvisation as a metaphysical principle (Chapter 5). Improvisation in music will be seen to be linked to the centrality of hope in human experience, and this will be exemplified in relation to certain cultures and twentieth-century composers (Chapter 6). Further to this connection between improvisation and hope, improvisation in a Christian liturgical context will be examined. There is a dearth of existing discussion, not only regarding improvisatory music in Christian liturgy, but liturgical spontaneity in general (Chapter 7).

 'On genealogy and ideology criticism'	 Allsobrook, Christopher John	 University of Sussex	 University of Sussex	2011	This thesis identifies and explains a fundamental philosophical problem of self-implication in Marxian ideology criticism that has led to its misuse and rejection in social theory and political philosophy. I argue that Friedrich Nietzsche's development of genealogy as a method of social criticism complements ideology criticism in a way that overcomes this problem, by addressing it explicitly, rather than trying to avoid it. In making this argument, I hope to bridge a widely perceived gap between Nietzsche's and Michel Foucault's genealogical approaches to social criticism, on the one hand, and Marxian ideology criticism on the other. The conflict between these approaches has been exaggerated in contemporary academic literature, to the loss of invaluable contributions Nietzsche and Foucault make to the theory and practice of ideology criticism. I begin by defining ideology in way that, I demonstrate, takes into account the use of the notion by Karl Marx and the early Frankfurt School Critical Theorists, Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno. I identify two central components of ideology, namely, an epistemic aspect, regarding illusion, and a functional aspect, which links ideology to its role in maintaining oppression. I also defend the notion of ideology against major objections to each of these aspects. In Chapter 4, I introduce the problem of self-implication that, I take it, poses the greatest challenge to the coherence of ideology criticism. The remainder of the thesis examines two alternative ways of dealing with this problem, namely immanent and transcendent criticism. I explain the weaknesses with each approach and, in doing so, show why Marx and Adorno each succumb to the problem of ideological self-implication. In the final chapter I argue that Nietzsche's method of genealogy is compatible with ideology criticism and can complement such criticism, to overcome the problems that have been examined.

 A conception of equality of opportunity	 Lazenby, Hugh T. C.	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2011	 This thesis defends a conception of equality of opportunity. It comes in two parts. The first part elaborates the conception. It begins by clarifying the concept of equality of opportunity, showing it to be made up of four basic elements: a distributive pattern, a set of subjects, an opportunity obstacle and a distributive object. The conception I build from these elements explains the value of the distributive pattern, equality, in terms of a concern for fairness, takes persons as its subject and takes well-being as its object. The conception presented is partial, rather than comprehensive, in that it does not include a detailed account of an opportunity obstacle. The conception of equality of opportunity that I present can also be characterised as a luck egalitarian principle. My aim in elaborating the conception is to show that it has intuitive appeal; it constitutes a pro tanto moral principle. The second part of the thesis examines the implications of luck egalitarianism in two contexts. It begins by examining the context of gifts, arguing that although luck egalitarianism is highly restrictive with respect to the freedom to give this only confirms that it is a merely pro tanto moral principle. It continues by examining the context of markets, arguing that luck egalitarianism makes intuitively correct judgments in several specified cases. My aim in applying luck egalitarianism is to show that its implications do not give us reason to reject its initial intuitive appeal. I examine luck egalitarianism generally, rather then the partial conception I elaborate, to allow for the possibility that my earlier arguments are wrong in some respect. Overall, I hope the arguments presented provide reasons to accept the conception presented as morally valuable.

 A pragmatic theory of truth and ontology	 Granger, Stewart Edward	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	1983	At the heart of my pragmatic theory of truth and ontology is a view of the relation between language and reality which I term internal justification: a way of explaining how sentences may have truth-values which we cannot discover without invoking the need for the mystery of a correspondence relation. The epistemology upon which the theory depend~ is fallibilist and holistic (chapter 2); places heavy reliance on modal idioms (chapter 4); and leads to the conclusion that current versions of realism and anti-realism are deficient (chapter 5). Just as my theory avoids the need for an epistemic 'given', it avoids the need for a metaphysical 'given' or 'joints'. I offer a view of the nature of philosophy and what it can properly achieve with respect to ontological questions (chapter 3); since those views lead me to believe that philosophical discussion about what exists should be restricted to 'entities' discussed in non-philosophical contexts, my views on how we should understand claims made about the existence of middle-sized physical objects (chapters 2 and 6), theoretical entities in science (chapter 6), and abstract entities in mathematics (chapter 7), give the thesis a schematic completeness. My theory leads me to a conception of inquiry which defends the cognitive status of moral statements whilst being critical of Kantian and utilitarian approaches to morality (chapter 8). Chapter 1 explores the views of my closest philosophical allies: William James and Nelson Goodman.	 Thesis or dissertation	 B Philosophy (General)	256298	1

 Knowledge and self-knowledge of emotions	 Zamuner, Edoardo	 University of Edinburgh	 University of Edinburgh	2008	 This thesis addresses two questions. One concerns the metaphysics of emotions and asks what kinds of mental states emotions are. The other asks how the metaphysics of emotions bears on first and third-personal knowledge of emotions. There are two prevailing views on the nature of emotions. They are the perception and cognitive views. The perception view argues that emotions are bodily feelings. The cognitive view, by contrast, contends that emotions are some sorts of evaluative judgments. I show that both views provide inadequate accounts of the nature of emotions. The perception view fails to do justice to the fact that emotions may not involve any bodily feeling. The cognitive view, by contrast, cannot account for the fact that emotions are states that adult humans have in common with infants and animals. On the basis of these criticisms, I put forward an alternative account of emotions. This involves five main arguments. The first is that emotions are enduring non-episodic dispositions that may or may not manifest themselves in experiential episodes such as emotional feelings and behaviour episodes such as expressions. The second argument is that emotional feelings are perceptions of specific bodily changes brought about by emotions. These feelings serve as clues as to what kinds of emotions the subject has. The third argument is that expressions are observable manifestations of emotions in virtue of which emotions can be perceived and subsequently known, directly and non-inferentially, by other people. The fourth argument is that when someone has an emotion without feeling it, she can still come to know it by believing true ascriptions that other people make about the emotion they perceive in her expression. The fifth argument is that full knowledge of emotions requires knowledge of the emotion objects.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	562199	1

 The general will in Rousseau's social contract	 McAdam, James	 Royal Holloway, University of London	 University of London	1958	 Sovereignty ought to remain perpetually in the will of the people. However, the contract to institute the sovereign state is illegitimate or unnecessary. There may be a practical necessity for a contract of union to bind the individuals to the common interest. The individual has, on this view, a common interest only as an associate. Likewise he has a general will for the common interest of the association. A detailed analysis of the main argument follows. Rousseau does not use "common interest" consistently. There is the permanent common interest, supposedly constant throughout the state's existence. The successive common interest, which is really comparable to a majority vote. Finally, there is the interest in the interests of all or the common good. This is, mainly, a moral sense. The Legislator provides artificially a moral education and creates a right tradition and social solidarity, instilling a regard for the common good. The general will represents the argument that there is a good for the state which the individuals do not know of. Rousseau advocates absolute sovereignty but, being a legislative function, it is limited by the nature of law. But a criterion of law is that the majority can make laws in accordance with their evaluation of the public utility. There are no individual rights, only sovereign rights, in this sense the general will is a moral sovereign. It is disinterested being the will for the good of all the citizens, not the sovereign will of the Kingdom of Ends. In contrast to Bosanquet it is an abstract universal; institutions, etc. are not objective embodiments of the general will. The general will is not one will, nor an analysis of a democratic state, but an ideal standard for popular sovereignty.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	703800	1

 Nihil ex nihilo : the archaeology of nothing : Heidegger and the inception of logos	 Tsagdis, Georgios	 Kingston University	 Kingston University	2013	 The essay at hand undertakes to think the inception of occidental thought as an event opening for the first time the horizon of the thought of Nothing. Although a study with and from, it is not a study of Heidegger, but a study of the inception (arche) of logos, as such an archaeology. The inception is delimited along the proper names of Anaximander, Heraclitus and Parmenides which we approach in reverse order, re-turning ever-closer to the origin that appears as ever-other, ever-distant. In this re-turn we try to understand the beginning, its truth and the task it presents us with, a task of essential thought. This task consists in the attempt of a turn of Being towards Nothing, a tum wherein essence is trans-formed from ex-istence, an existence foreign to every existentialism. In this thematization of the lesion between 'essentia' and 'existentia' comprising itself a distinct history of Being, a change of tone takes effect, a change of tone that cor-responds to the essence of the turn that we come to know as 'tropos'. The tropos of Being, its essence of turning, emerges inceptively thus in the re-turn of Nothing, the jointure and origin of presence and absence, what opens and maintains the field of their oscillation. This Nothing we try to trace across the inception so that a new beginning may be granted to us, a new beginning that is always the first.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	587386	1

 Chance and determinism in Ibn Sīnā and Ibn Rushd	 Belo, Catarina Carriço Marques de Moura	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2004	This thesis analyses the concept of 'chance' as it is understood by two Muslim philosophers, Ibn Sīnā (Lat. Avicenna, CE 980-1037) and Ibn Rushd (Lat. Averroes, CE 1126-1198). On the philosophical plane, I seek to ascertain whether they are determinists, i.e., whether they hold that everything that happens is necessarily conditioned by its causes so that it could not have been otherwise. This analysis discusses chance from a physical and a metaphysical perspective. Physics is here understood in the Aristotelian sense as the study of nature and change, and metaphysics as the study of being qua being (ontology) and of the divine (theology). Hence a particular stress on natural causation and on divine providence and causation. On the historical-philosophical plane I endeavour to determine the historical/philosophical sources of their views, namely the Graeco-Arabic philosophical tradition - Aristotelian and Neoplatonic on the one Band, and the tradition of Islamic theology (kalām) on the other. Particular emphasis is laid upon the original way in which Ibn Sīnā and Ibn Rushd combine these two traditions.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Chance ; Determinism (Philosophy)	408091	1
 Application of Confucian and Western ethical theories in developing HIV/AIDS policies in China : an essay in cross-cultural bioethics	 Ma, Yonghui	 University of Manchester	 University of Manchester	2013	 This study is a contribution to Chinese-Western dialogue of bioethics but perhaps the first one of its kind. From a Chinese-Western comparative ethical perspective, this work brings Chinese ethical theories, especially Confucian ethics, into a contemporary context of the epidemic of HIV/AIDS, and to see how the deeply-rooted thoughts of Confucius interact, compete, or integrate with concepts from Western ethical traditions. An underlying belief is that some ideas in Confucian ethics are important and insightful beyond their cultural and historical origins in China and other Confucianism influenced societies.Methodologically, this thesis employs two approaches, conceptual normative analysis combined with critical interpretation. The ‘interpretive’ approach I employ, as an important methodology supplementing my normative analysis, not only deals with Chinese ancient texts, but also explains specific beliefs and practices in China.With a critical eye, this thesis carefully examines a number of key topics in the ethics of AIDS in China from a cross-cultural perspective. Topics including: views on personhood and the vulnerability of People Living with HIV/AIDS; prioritising and balancing the role of ‘harm reduction’ and the role of ‘eradication of deviant behaviour’ in AIDS policy in China; rights-based opt-out approach and duty-based family-centred approach in HIV testing and Biobanking; blood donation; moral responsibility and personal responsibility for health; and the popular rhetoric of ‘innocent infection’ versus ‘guilty infection’ in AIDS. My overall aim in this work is to present a cross-cultural bioethics study through the investigation of some ethical issues in AIDS in China from a Chinese-Western comparative perspective and also attempt to suggest a humane and effective policy for HIV/AIDS which I believe is appropriate to both traditions. I believe this work has contributed to our knowledge in three related but independent areas: the control of the epidemic of HIV/AIDS in China; medical ethics in China; and to both the methods and the utility of cross-cultural study of bioethics between China and the West.

Lewi Pethrus' ecclesiological thought 1911-1974 : a transdenominational Pentecostal ecclesiology	 Davidsson, Tommy Henrik	 University of Birmingham	 University of Birmingham	2012	This thesis is a diachronic investigation of Lewi Pethrus’ ecclesiological thought from 1911 to 1974. The research employs Roger Haight’s transdenominational ecclesiology as its methodological framework. Since Haight’s methodology is based on a concrete ecclesiological method that emphasises the importance of a historical consciousness in ecclesiology, the study particularly focuses on the formative contexts that shaped Pethrus’ ecclesiology. The emphasis on formative contexts not only explains why certain ecclesiological concepts arose at particular points in Pethrus’ life but also clarifies why concepts were abandoned or developed over time. A vital part of Haight’s methodology is also to examine the religious values that remain constant and significantly form ecclesiological views. The thesis argues that Pethrus’ ecclesiology is shaped by a Pentecostal form of spirituality that has ‘loving Christ and loving neighbour’ as its core values. The combination of a Pentecostal form of spirituality and formative contexts is what makes Pethrus’ ecclesiology ‘Pentecostal’ and gives it its inner logic. The thesis concludes by taking this inner logic of Pethrus’ ecclesiology and hypothetically applying it to a global setting. The result is a contribution toward a transdenominational Pentecostal ecclesiology that has important implications for any attempt to construct a global Pentecostal ecclesiology.

 Creative involution : overcoming man : becoming-woman	 Crawford, Jane-Ann	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	2001	 The thesis is written in the pursuit of true difference. Its contention is that true difference has been obscured by a model of difference which is dialectical in nature. Western thought has been largely informed by a metaphysic in which difference has been subordinated to the One and the Identical and which can only ever return as the Same. In utilising the writings of Foucault, Deleuze, Deleuze-Nietzsche, Deleuze-Bergson and Bergson, this thesis strives to find for a new image of thought, that can go beyond representation through which true difference can be known. The thesis is framed in the context of the problematic of 'the death of man' as that which Foucault formulates as eternally returning as the Same. Foucault raises the question of Man's disappearance and in doing so also opens up the question of what might come after Man. It will be argued, that what comes after man, that which Nietzsche has named the Overman, is the becoming-woman of man. The aim is to show that becoming-woman, once freed from the representational system, can be thought of as an active, affirmative death through which difference can be thought in-itself as the continual movement of vital life The nature of a Becoming-woman is, in turn, framed in the context of Deleuze's search for difference in-itself and, Bergson's philosophy of nature. It will be argued, in conclusion, that becoming-woman is the rebirth of the eternal return of difference which, in man, reaches into the consciousness of self.

 Duties in the wake of atrocity : a normative analysis of post-atrocity peacebuilding	 Hermanson, Chrisantha	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2013	 Over the last two decades, the international community has taken on the task of rebuilding societies in the aftermath of mass-atrocities. Through a combination of trial and error and vigorous academic research, a relatively clear (and semi-malleable) blueprint of post-atrocity peacebuilding has developed. This includes setting up a temporary international transitional authority, establishing democracy, facilitating economic development, and holding war crime trials. Though there are volumes of studies which address the pragmatic strengths and weaknesses of these key elements of peacebuilding, to date political theorists have not critically analyzed the moral legitimacy of these policies. My thesis aims to fill this gap. The overarching question of this thesis is this: What moral duties does the international community have to post-atrocity societies? To answer this question, I critically examine the normative issues involved in the four key aspects of peacebuilding (identified above). Using the framework of just war theory and a cosmopolitan theory of fundamental human rights, I argue that, in most post-atrocity cases, the international community has duties to remove atrocity-committing regimes from power, occupy the target-state and act as a transitional authority, help facilitate the creation of democracy and economic development, and hold war crimes trials. These duties, of course, are extremely complicated and limited and these qualifications are examined and developed throughout. Running through the construction of my theory of post-atrocity duties is a clear message: we – the international community – have obligations to the victims and survivors of atrocities. In other words, providing assistance in the wake of mass-atrocities is not a supererogatory act of charity, rather, it is a duty which we owe to the victims of these horrible crimes.

 A philosophy as old as Homer : Giacomo Leopardi and Greek poetic pessimism	 Franzoni, Maria Giulia	 University of St Andrews	 University of St Andrews	2017	The aim of this thesis is twofold: it explores Giacomo Leopardi's (1798-1837) interpretation of, and engagement with, Greek pessimistic thought and, through him, it investigates the complex and elusive phenomenon of Greek pessimistic thought itself. This thesis contends that Greek pessimistic thought – epitomised by but not limited to the famous wisdom of Silenus, the µὴ φῦναι topos – is an important element of Greek thought, a fundamental part of some of Greece's greatest literary works, and a vital element in the understanding of Greek culture in general. Yet this aspect of ancient thought has not yet received the attention it deserves, and in the history of its interpretation it has often been forgotten, denied, or purposefully obliterated. Furthermore, the pessimistic side of Greek thought plays a crucial role in both the modern history of the interpretation of antiquity and the intellectual history of Europe; I argue that this history is fundamentally incomplete without the appreciation of Leopardi's role in it. By his study of and engagement with ancient sources Leopardi contributed to the 19th century rediscovery of Greek pessimistic wisdom, alongside, though chronologically before, the likes of Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Jacob Burckhardt. Having outlined some fundamental steps in the history of the reception of Greek pessimism, this thesis examines the cardinal components of Leopardi's reception of it: his use of Greek conceptions of humanity to undermine modernity's anthropocentric fallacy, his reinterpretation of the Homeric simile of the leaves and its pessimistic undertones, and his views on the idea that it would be best for man not to be born.

 The theology of God and the Gentile mission in Acts	 Muthuraj, Joseph Gnanaseelan	 Durham University	 Durham University	1995	The present study aims to investigate Luke's theology of God in the accounts of the mission to the Gentiles in Acts. In Acts, God is portrayed as the cause of the mission. It is God who inaugurates and guides the Gentile mission. For Luke, God who acts is God who has fixed the times and seasons. The mission is described as part of God's times, past, present and future. It is mission by God. The Gentile mission is also mission about God. The "cause" of the mission becomes the content'. This fact is not widely recognised by studies in Luke-Acts. God' is prominent in the speeches in the Gentile mission narratives of Samaria (8: 4-25), Caesarea (10: 33- 43), Lystra (14: 8-18), Athens (17: 16-34) and Ephesus (19: 21- 41). We examine these narratives to analyse the speeches in their immediate contexts provided in the narrative itself. Except in Ac. 10, Luke's contexts contain details concerning Gentiles" belief and worship of god/goddess/gods which in Luke's view represent false notions about God. The fundamental issue in the theology of God in all these narratives is confusion of the human with the divine. That men and works of men are neither God nor manifestations of God is the essence of the theological kerygma. In Ac. 10, Peter's own wrong notion of God is corrected and his new knowledge about God leads to the conversion of the Gentiles. God who is proclaimed to the Gentiles is God who does 'mighty acts". We consider two more narratives, 12: 21-24 and 28: 1-10, in which Gentile notions of god are presented without kerygma attached to them. The former can be classified with the mission narratives since all of them function as model settings to Luke's readers, illustrating how mission ought to take place in circumstances in which similar false understandings of God are found. The latter episode is an example of Luke's positive use of Gentile notions of god as 'justice' to attest the innocence of Paul, the prisoner and missionary to Rome. In the description of the Gentile mission in Acts, Luke emerges as a theologian of God.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	260087	1
 The dialectics of eros : from Plato to Dante	 De Forest Duer, Alexandra	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	2003	 Though Dante never read Plato's dialogues on love, when examining the texts of Dante one notes the presence of Platonic thought and influence particularly concerning the notion of love. This thesis will focus upon the Platonic notion of eros and how it changes over time, ultimately being integrated into the Christian notion of love as understood by Dante, and how this Platonic influence is instantiated within Dante's poetry. The inherent ambiguity of the concept of love, evident historically through frequent debates concerning its value whether positive, negative or in-between, makes any investigation into the nature of love problematic, often aporetic. One aim of this thesis is to help overcome some of the aporiai of knowledge concerning love through focusing upon one form of love, eros or passionate desire, which we shall use in order to understand love more generally through exploring its points of intersection and overlapping with certain other types of love, each of which emphasizes different aspects of love's character differentiated through culture and period. Significantly eros, as perhaps the most ambiguous type of love, is often characterized negatively. Taking into account Nygren's negative view of eros which he sees as being wholly acquisitive and self-seeking as opposed to the thoroughly selfless Christian agape, we shall consider whether this view tells the full truth about eros. In this endeavour we shall explore the interrelationship of eros and understanding understood as a dialectic directed towards the pursuit of truth, which in both the Platonic and Christian traditions involves the permanent possession of the good, beautiful and true; these converge in Neo-Platonic tradition, forming a unity which in Christianity is identified with God. We shall also explore how various strands of eros relate to and articulate the notion of love of the individual. These explorations cast light on the transformation of Platonic eros by Christian agape into the Latin concept of caritas. In terms of procedure, we shall examine the notion of Platonic eros as presented in the Symposium and the Phaedrus and how this conception is reinterpreted in Dante's Commedia, these texts together acting as a lens which -will enable us better to comprehend the significance of Bros, and of love more generally, through the transformation of eros over time.

 The use of the concept 'fear' in Deuteronomy to denote the relationship between God and Israel	 Chingota, Felix L. B.	 University of Aberdeen	 University of Aberdeen	1991	This thesis aims to clarify the exclusive use by the Deuteronomic writers of the root hskip 0.75cm to denote the relationship between God and Israel. This problem is raised by the fact that there were other roots - break vskip 0.2cm and hskip 0.6cm - which they could have used. In trying to explain the Deuteronomic use of the root hskip 0.75cm the insights of semantic theory according to which 'meaning' is defined in terms of 'sense-relations' a term contracts with other terms in the vocabulary of a given language have been used. Also used are the insights of field meaning analysis according to which the meaning of a term is defined in terms of its relationship with other terms within its lexical field. In this connection, the 'sense-relations' which the hskip 0.75cm contracts are compared with those which the other roots contract. In this way, the particular usage of the break root nobreak hskip 0.75cm	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	292702	1
 The psychotheology of sin and salvation	 Axton, Paul Vincent	 University of Nottingham	 University of Nottingham	2013	This dissertation, by employing the work of Slavoj Žižek in his engagement with the Apostle Paul, argues that Paul, in Romans 6-8, understands sin as a lie grounding the Subject outside of Christ and salvation as an exposure and displacement of this lie as one is joined to the body of Christ. In this understanding salvation may be seen primarily in terms of an overcoming of alienation from God, neighbour and self through participation in the Trinity (adoption by the Father through the Son by means of the Spirit), which stands in contrast to the sinful Subject who in his inner alienation and his alienation from God and others is oriented by a deceitful death dealing desire that would find life in the law rather than in God. The specific theological significance of Žižek (along with his predecessors Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan) is his demonstration of the pervasive and systemic nature of this lie (chapter 1) and its description as he finds it in Romans 7 (chapter 2). The general significance this account might have for theology is to frame the concept of sin as a deception (reifying the self) with its own logic, dynamic, and structure, similar to the Subject of psychoanalysis, and salvation, in turn, can be understood as the place and means from which the Subject of sin and its destructive nature are understood and displaced by new life in Christ (chapter 3). Sin and salvation, under this notion, are not forensic categories but have to do with the lived reality of identity, of being either a Subject oriented to death or to life.

A postcolonial critique of industrial design : a critical evaluation of the relationship of culture and hegemony to design practice and education since the late 20th century	 Begum, Taslima	 University of Plymouth	 University of Plymouth	2015	This thesis specifically focuses on the professional practices and training of Western industrial designers using postcolonial theory to inform working practices in a complex global ecology. It investigates the culturally hegemonic construction of design solutions in man-made products. By adopting key ideas from postcolonial and cultural studies as a lens to evaluate fields of industrial design discourse, practice and pedagogy, the work proceeds from the premise that design is not intrinsic to a product but the result of a myriad different forces and factors acting on it externally including hegemonic potencies. By reinterpreting technological formations in light of research emerging from post-colonial studies, it attempts to broaden our intellectual understanding of how product design in theory, practice and education can often rely upon western [hegemonic] aesthetic and deep cultural archetypes. The purpose of this enquiry is to highlight the potentials that exist to explore a synergy between east and west in industrial design with a prospective vision for global, trans-cultural design. The research claims that current design practice often leads to culturally determined - rather than universal - conceptions in design and it attempts to re-conceptualise design as practice within a necessarily hegemonic culture. This hegemony needs to be acknowledged and redressed via increased awareness and changes to the intellectual heritage and autonomy of West European and American industrial design, in its dialogue, practice and education. As an epistemological project to identify knowledge within this discourse, it suggests new methodological and strategic approaches to engage with the crisis the discipline faces in light of globalisation so as to open up future discussions in design discourse and give a voice to the many silences that make up the noise of the world. It attempts to: • Further understand the trajectory of hegemony and globalisation in relation to design, technology and culture. • Critically engage with cross- and trans-cultural, global and social design implications. • Address the discrepancies between designers’ culture and users’ culture, to expose the necessity for more culturally-cognizant design practice and pedagogic provision. The research was initiated by identifying a number of questions that designers and users may consciously or subconsciously confront when faced with products that problematise the imagined universal values of designed products in terms of gender and culture. It explores how certain design solutions produced and developed in the west and their diffusion into global, international markets and foreign cultures could affect those cultures by asking in what ways the usability, aesthetic and symbolic characteristics of these artefacts often unwittingly contribute to the privilege or marginalisation of people from particular socio-cultural backgrounds. The thesis intervention is that product designers are neither explicitly trained to comprehend nor surmount their respective cultural constraints and design education both nationally and internationally is not sufficiently equipped with the tools to acknowledge and confront this. The key arguments presented in this thesis are: 1. Products can often be deconstructed to identify cultural connotations or omissions in their design. 2.

 Realism and anti-realism	 Pearson, Philip	 University of Leicester	 University of Leicester	1986	 Michael Dummett has proposed a means of characterising a range of traditional philosophical disputes. This method is intended to highlight the similarities which exist between these disputes and by this means to facilitate their solution. Within the characterisation each dispute is regarded as a conflict between proponents of different theories of meaning. This proposed characterisation, its validity and usefulness, form the main topic of consideration within this thesis. An exposition of the realist/anti-realist characterisation is presented which attempts to summarise the important features of Dummett's writings on this' topic. Subsequently attention is given over to a critical appraisal of this approach. The appraisal falls into two phases. The first of these is parochial in the sense that the topics discussed are internal to the framework of the characterisation. In the second phase the characterisation is viewed from further back and the relationship between it and its Wittgensteinian origins are examined. The first phase of the appraisal initially centres around issues which have arisen within the literature. One feature which emerges at this stage is that certain concepts which are central to the characterisation are in need of more precise specification. Further concerns regarding the specification are uncovered as the assessment extends beyond the published literature. In the second phase Wittgenstein's work on privacy is reviewed in some detail. It is concluded from this phase that some of the main disputes intended to be covered by the characterisation are in fact forestalled by Wittgenstein's work. Also it is suggested that the intended adoption of Wittgenstein's approach to meaning, within the characterisation, runs counter to Wittgenstein's intent. Overall it is concluded that the proposed characterisation is in need of better specification but that even if this is achieved, the approach to meaning which is being advocated is one which may not be sustainable.

 Discourse on rationality : rational choice and critical theory	 Madiraju, Santhosh Kumar	 University of Glasgow	 University of Glasgow	1996	The thesis contrasts two hostile and divergent intellectual paradigms in social sciences: rational choice and critical theory. Both rational choice and critical theory offer contrasting perspectives on the structures of social interaction. However, both critical theory and rational choice theory share overlapping concerns ie., both are preoccupied with determining what rational can mean in the realm of social and political interaction. In the case of rational choice paradigm, instrumental reason forms the cornerstone of the theoretical edifice. Ever since the publication of Jurgen Habermas' The lhemy qf Communicative Action Vol. / (1984) and Vol. II (1986) instrumental reason has come under severe attack. His critique anchors on a theory of communicative reason. What makes Habermas' work distinctive is that he does not regard instrumental reason as the single inevitable concomitant of modernity. Habermas sees in modernity an alternative way of conceptualising social interaction in terms of communication rather than strategy. So in a way, his work is a challenge to the defenders of modernity aiming to build a unified social science Jurgen Habermas advances the notion of communicative reason as the centerpiece of a social theory as opposed to instrumental reason. By providing a systematic grounding of the concept of reason in human language, he hopes to establish normative basis of critical theory. This model of reaching agreement or consent constitutes a process of dialogue in which reasons are exchanged between participants. This process is perceived to be a joint search for consensus. Such a dialogic concept of collective choice would necessarily work not with fixed preferences to be amalgamated (as rational choice theories do) but with preferences that are altered or modified as competing reasons are advanced in the course of discussion. In rational discussion, the only thing supposed to count is the power of better argument. Both rational choice and critical theory conceptualise politics in different ways. Rational choice theories critique democratic mechanisms failing to generate general will. Consequently, the political prescriptions offered are limited government or market. On the contrary, the political implications of Habermas' theory of deliberative democracy is anchored in the notion of liberal public sphere envisaging a cognitivist, rationalist vision in which discourse forms a critical normative basis for evaluating the political and moral principles.

 Philosophical reflections on the nature of psychosis	 Broome, Matthew R.	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	2014	The papers included in the thesis, and summarized in this covering document, were selected, in discussion with my supervisor, Dr. Roessler, from papers I have published in the philosophy of psychiatry. In parallel to this philosophical work, I have worked clinically as a psychiatrist and academically as a research psychiatrist. My clinical work has largely been working with Early Intervention Services, both in South London and in Coventry and Warwickshire, and this work has been acting as a psychiatrist in clinical teams who work with young people who may either be at risk of developing a psychotic illness, or are in the earliest stages of such an illness. My empirical work has been in the same clinical group and has used functional neuroimaging and cognitive neuropsychology to characterize those at risk of psychosis and to chart the onset of psychosis and the formation of delusions. As required by the university guidelines, a full list of publications, both empirical and philosophical, is detailed in appendix 1. The papers included in the thesis hence parallel many of these clinical and empirical interests: papers 2 and 4, in particular, examine the role neuroimaging may play in studying delusions and relate the prodromal phase of psychosis to both the neurodevelopmental and continuum models of psychosis. Paper 3 is one of two papers written with Lisa Bortolotti drawing on Richard Moran’s work and examining delusions. Paper 1 is perhaps the paper least connected to my empirical and clinical work as has a wider focus and tries to examine what mental illnesses are and to begin to describe a position Lisa Bortolotti and I later expanded on and referred to as ‘psychological realism’, with Paper 2 being a case example of this account being applied to a particular area of psychopathology, namely delusions. The papers form a progression with Paper 1 outlining a general conception of mental disorder, Paper 2 being a case study of this approach specifically in the area of delusion. Paper 3 takes the example of thought insertion and develops ideas from Paper 2 that reason giving is a crucial feature that helps highlight what is pathological about certain experiences. Paper 4 brings together the philosophical concerns regarding a wholly neuroscientific conception of psychopathology, and how this is of clinical and scientific relevance when we use psychopathology to demarcate the various stages of psychotic experience and illness.

 Apocryphal theatre : practicing philosophies	 Barclay, Julia Lee	 University of Northampton	 University of Northampton	2009	 Apocryphal Theatre: Practising Philosophies is a practice-based research project that consists of examples of my theatre practice (as research) and a written thesis. In this thesis, I argue that theatre can be seen to be an act of philosophy, by tessellating Maurice Merleau-Ponty's definition of philosophy as consisting of relearning to look at the world and Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari's proposition that philosophy is the creation of concepts, and pointing to post-WWII theatre artists whose work both fulfill this definition of philosophy and have informed Apocryphal Theatre's work. Included is an analysis of interviews with three contemporary theatre artists, Richard Foreman, Chris Goode and Ivana Muller, which explore their relationship with philosophical ideas in their work and how that informs their ability to create acts of philosophy. In practice, the research questions that underpin Apocryphal Theatre's research in labs, rehearsals and performance, are philosophical and create the potential for collective acts of philosophy. Apocryphal's practice as research as manifest in its ongoing lab and in the two productions included as part of this thesis, The Jesus Guy and Besides, you lose your soul or The History of Western Civilisation, will be analysed for the historical and philosophical bases of the primary concepts we have created through our research and the tools with which we embody them. The concepts and tools, which are used to address the research questions, are the witness, the grid, cutting up, levels of address and levels of presence. This thesis concludes that theatre and philosophy whilst separate disciplines can overlap in such a way that acts of philosophy can occur in the theatre, and that Apocryphal's theatrical project, which is collaborative, polyvocal and in performance invites the audience to be active witness/participants in the creation of the event, can be viewed as a collective act of philosophy.

 The futurity compact : anticipation, interdependence and contract : the possibility and circumstances of justice over time	 McCormick, Hugh	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2012	 This thesis is about justice between people born at different times: the way in which they interact and the extent to which those interactions can be a matter of justice. Its principal aims are: to present certain theories that describe what justice over time might look like; to present certain theoretical problems for this subject; and to understand the impact of these problems upon these theories. The thesis draws mainly upon: the work of David Hume, John Rawls and David Gauthier as sources of certain social contract theories; and the work of Wilfred Beckerman, Gustaf Arrhenius and Derek Parfit for certain problems faced by these theories. The central argument of the thesis is that the theoretical obstacles to the application of justice thrown up by the temporal dimension are not as significant as they might appear. In particular, there are good reasons to believe that social contract theories are more susceptible to intertemporal extension and less encumbered by temporally-related problems than previously thought. The conclusion of the thesis is that, issuing from a clearer view of certain theoretical obstacles to their inclusion, there is significant potential for future people to be considered within the scope of justice over time as described by certain social contract theories and that present people have self-interested reasons to take this project seriously.

 Measuring sexual interests with pupillary responses	 Attard-Johnson, Janice	 University of Kent	 University of Kent	2016	During the visual processing of sexual content, pupillary responses have been positively associated with observers' sexual orientation. The question of whether this measure also reflects age-specific sexual preferences, however, is rarely considered. This is remarkable given the potential applied value of pupillary responses for directly measuring unhealthy and inappropriate sexual desires in clinical and forensic settings. The experiments in this thesis addressed this question with a series of tasks whereby observers' viewed images of adults and children while their eye movements and pupil responses were recorded. These results were then compared with sexual appeal ratings for these images and self-report questionnaires relating to sexual interests and experiences. The main findings indicate that pupil dilation is a measure of sexual orientation that is particularly robust and consistent for male participants (Chapters 2 to 4). Furthermore, these experiments provide initial evidence that pupil dilation could also be used as an age-specific measure of sexual interest in males and females (Chapters 2 and 3). Additionally, this thesis explored the influence of low-level stimulus artefacts within the scenes on pupillary patterns (Chapter 2). Findings provide further evidence that the pupillary responses obtained in these experiments are driven by the person content in the scenes. These findings are discussed in relation to existing research on eye-tracking and other current measurements of sexual interest.	 Thesis or dissertation	 B Philosophy. Psychology. Religion	713013	1

 Does God suffer? : divine passibility in Anglican theology from Lux mundi to the Second War : with particular reference to the thought of William Temple and John Kenneth Mozely	 Smoot, Jonathan Frederick	 University of Aberdeen	 University of Aberdeen	1996	There was a remarkably rich and fertile period in British theology from the latter end of the nineteenth century to the outbreak of the Second World War. Some of the greatest growth with the most far-reaching implications for theology took place in the doctrine of God; particularly in the area of divine passibility. The objectives of the study are four-fold; 1) to concisely establish the origin and historical development of divine impassability and its impact upon classical theism, and to identify the chief linguistic and theological concerns of the doctrine, 2) to extensively document the confluence of religious, philosophical, and cultural factors within the life-setting of Anglicanism and British society which created the conditions for a dynamic reformation in the Anglican doctrine of God, 3) to demonstrate the outcome of this metanoia in the effectual dismantling of divine impassability in favour of a sustained and irrevocable advancement or enrichment in the Anglican idea of God, and 4) to establish as theological conversation partners William Temple and John Kenneth Mozley as representative Anglican theologians from our period of study. Two primary methods are employed in the study; 1) the critical analysis of the idea of the suffering of God within Anglicanism as viewed through the lens of the strengths and weaknesses of Temple's and Mozley's respective contributions to the impassability debates within English theology, 2) the chief vehicle for the pursuit of this analysis is a full exploration and application of the "six necessary questions" for inquiry into impassability posed by John Kenneth Mozley. These six questions form the framework for the theological conversation between Temple and Mozley undertaken in this thesis.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	338400	1

 A manifesto for nonsense : the futurist drive in Deleuze's poetics	 Palmer, Helen	 Goldsmiths College (University of London)	 Goldsmiths College (University of London)	2012	 This thesis presents a critical analysis of Deleuze’s philosophy of language, using and examining Russian and Italian futurist manifestos to draw out the ‘futurist’ aspects of Deleuze’s language and thought. These aspects constitute a poetics of Deleuze as well as a poetics of the avant-garde, presenting in both areas the celebrated, utopian state of language as dynamic, performative matter. The way in which futurist manifestos often attempt to perform and demand their aims simultaneously, and the temporal problems which arise due to this, is an operation which can be perceived in Deleuze’s writing. The difference between writing which describes a linguistic practice and writing which performs this linguistic practice is a temporal gap requiring a double operation of description and enactment, which the performative manifesto purports to fulfil. In both Deleuzian and futurist poetics, however, the fulfilment of this double operation can lead to problematic territory. Deleuze presents several linguistic practices in The Logic of Sense which can also be located in the writings of both Russian and Italian futurists, despite the differing political and aesthetic programmes of these variants of the movement. The common element identified and examined in this thesis is an accelerative drive to eliminate the temporal gap between items in an analogical equation so that synonymy is no longer an inexact science; the conjunction and the copula are truncated and cleave together, resulting in radical linguistic becoming. My argument is that minute technical linguistic modifications such as these operate synecdochically within futurist and Deleuze’s poetics, standing for their creators’ entire conceptual systems. Ultimately, the paradoxes inherent in the relationship between the radical fluidity of futurist nonsense and the radical fixity of its ensuing formalism provide a new way of thinking about Deleuze’s approach to language.

 The Sunni concept of Jihad in classical Fiqh and modern Islamic thought	 Alsumaih, Abdulrahman Muhammad	 University of Newcastle upon Tyne	 Neewcastle University	1998	 This thesis has two main purposes. First, it aims to analyse the Shari 'h law of Jihd, through investigation of the Quran, the Sunria and the works of earlier prominent Muslim jurists (fuqaha) and therefore elucidate the nature of JihZzd and its components. It is the Muslims belief that the Holy Quran and the Sunna were fixed for all time during the foundation of Islam which therefore suggests that the Shari 'h law itself must be unchangeable as the Holy Quran and the Sunna are its two principal sources. However it is reasonable to assume that learned jurists, in applying the Shari 'h to a particular set of circumstances during their time, may interpret the Shari 'h in different ways. The second major purpose of this thesis is to test the hypothesis that human interpretation of the Shari 'h law on Jihad will differ over time. It therefore examines the jurists interpretations during the period from the beginning of the Umayyad dynasty to the present day. The comparison between this period, that of the Prophet's time and the Four Guided Caliphs is divided into three parts. The first is the Islamic State under the Umayyad, Abbasid and Ottoman dynasties. The second is the Islamist modernists of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The third is the group of Muslim religious scholars who are known as fundamentalists in the West. One of the key findings of this thesis is that there was a considerable difference in the interpretation of the law of Jihad by the modernists. Extraordinary though it is, this is the ne exception in over thirteen hundred years in which there seems to have been no significant changes in the interpretation of JihaTl by the fuqaha.This thesis investigates the role of the fuqah in applying Jihdto specific situations both by Islamic rulers and by the umma. This study also aims to clarify why, on the one hand the majority of classical Muslim juristsfuqah supported the use of Jihd to overthrow a kJIr ruler, they, on the other hand, refused the use of force to change an unjust Immam as the use of such force could lead to the JItna inside the Islamic state. These views of earlier jurists were of noticeable importance to contemporary scholars as the theory of Jihad in the past concentrated on the use of force against non-Muslims, whilst nowadays different angles are adopted by some groups who claim that Muslim rulers are apostate and therefore ask their followers to use force against them. This view led modern jurists to concentrate on such views and to disprove the evidence on which these groups have based their views. The thesis is about the law of Jihä and its interpretation and application in various circumstances, it is not about the practice of Jihad as such except in so far as changes in the way Jihad has been waged which have affected its interpretation by the fuqah and others.

 Connecting man and nature : philosophical meanings of Zhu Xi's poetry	 Liu, Siyu	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2014	My thesis closely analyzes the shi poetry of the Song dynasty philosopher Zhu Xi (1130-1200). I look at its deep structure, especially the tensions embedded therein between literature and philosophy, and between his inner mind and the external world, manifested in ways different from what he taught in his philosophical works. Although his poetry itself is not considered to be aesthetically outstanding, I suggest that it is crucial to a better understanding of the evolution of Zhu’s philosophical project on the relationship between humans and the natural world. Zhu Xi wanted to establish and defend a coherent and practical self-cultivation theory, which would enable people to recognize the dao through daily experiences. Nevertheless, in his poetry production, he was facing a long-entrenched influential poetic tradition with its emphasis on the outer world described by embellished words and spontaneous overflow of emotions, while leaving an open end for the meanings or less discriminatively appealing to the Daoist or Buddhist idea of transcendence, the logic of which fundamentally contradicts that of daoxue construction. This made it impossible to achieve the dao in a this-worldly fashion. The contradiction had to be reconciled by Zhu Xi in his poems, an issue that he actually wrestled with throughout his life. Consequently, the style of Zhu Xi’s poetry was differentiated from both that of other Neo-Confucians and indeed that of any other poets in Chinese history. In his poetic texts, the tension between the outer world, inner emotions and philosophical inclination is more intensified, and the exploration of the relationship between man and nature more focused and conscious. In this thesis, I present an aesthetic world of Zhu Xi beyond all his ambiguous philosophical discussions, unfavorable comments on poetry, and his profoundly contradictory attitudes towards versifying.

 Narrow gates, strait ways : the postmodern sacred and the icon	 Vella, David	 Cardiff University	 Cardiff University	2012	 This study compares two prevalent notions in postmodern philosophy and critical-cultural theory: the sacred and the icon. On the one hand, the sacred has often been described as the exposure to an abyssal reality that is completely foreign to human perception and control. This deeply subversive event is presented through two of its most influential thinkers, Georges Bataille and Maurice Blanchot. On the other hand, the icon marks the experience of a sensitivity to the singular selfhood of the other. It comprises a loving receptivity to its unique identity, in particular the identity of the human or divine stranger who is excluded or victimized by human narratives and structures. Intrinsic to the ethical scene, as I show through Emmanuel Levinas and Richard Kearney, is an interaction rather than a subjugation of the subject by the other. This project seeks to present the similarities and differences between the sacred and the icon. In particular, it calls for a certain relationship between them, allowing both to be observed in each other’s respective light. Both are thus re-examined through their relation to each other. Moreover, this bond is seen to be ethically significant for either phenomenon and it helps redefine the sacred and the icon in a manner that is closer to actual experience. It also perceives either one in terms of a practical efficacy. To exemplify these views, the Christian mystical experience known as the ‘passive dark night of the soul’ is explored insofar as it constitutes one of the most radical instances of the icon. Crucial to this relationship is its exposure of the possible shortcomings and misjudgements of previous conceptions of the sacred. A potential new role for the sacred is indicated: a function that is at once more ethical and constructive. Above all, the underlying concern of this study is the very nature of this interaction of the two extremes. Throughout, it shows this affiliation as dialectical by nature. Between the sacred and the icon, a process of a mutual coinciding and estranging takes place.	 Thesis or dissertation	 B Philosophy (General)	567407	1
 Beyond the social and political : a synthesis of the political theories of Hannah Arendt and Michael Foucault	 Edwards, Claire Jane	 University of Sussex	 University of Sussex	2012	 This thesis argues for a move beyond the division of contemporary western experiences into separate social and political spheres. This includes a comparative study of the theories of Hannah Arendt and Michel Foucault alongside historical and contemporary examples in support of the relevance of their theories and that of this thesis. The synthesis between Arendt and Foucault made here corrects the respective weaknesses in each theory by using the strengths of the other. Furthermore, this synthesis informs a move beyond the social and political referred to above. The critique of sovereignty, the defence of plurality and the critique of instrumental reason are shown here as the most important parallels between the two thinkers and the central ways that people in contemporary western society are disempowered. This thesis argues for a reconsideration of these issues in order to redress this disempowerment. The thesis also looks at the major divergence between the two thinkers which is shown to rest on their respective treatment of the social and political. This argument rejects the Arendtian argument for the separation of the social and political to favour Foucauldian resistance located on and within the everyday experiences of western individuals. This shown to be political action rooted in the social aspects of the individuals' lives and stands in opposition to the claims of Arendt regarding the social. However, this retains the political strengths of her vision. The synthesis of the strengths of both theorists alongside the ultimate rejection of the Arendtian separation of the social and political that this Foucauldian resistance exemplifies is concluded as constituting a move beyond the social and political to have more relevance, meaning and ultimate empowerment for individuals because it more accurately reflects the realities of their everyday lives.

 Hume's conception of character	 Mahoney, Robert Heath	 University of Southampton	 University of Southampton	2009	 The thesis reconstructs Hume’s conception of character. Character is not just an ethical concern in Hume’s philosophy: Hume emphasises the importance of character in his ethics, aesthetics and history. The reconstruction therefore pays attention to Hume’s usage of the concept of character in his clearly philosophical works, the Treatise of Human Nature and the two Enquiries, as well as his less obviously philosophical works, the Essays, Moral, Political and Literary and the History of England. The first main thesis is that Hume’s conception of character includes multiple heterogeneous elements. These include passions, habits, natural abilities and possibly general rules. These elements are combined to form a coherent character through social organisation and conventions. The elements underpin character attributions, but it is argued that Hume is not concerned with identifying elements with character traits, as he is interested in characters as a whole rather than individual traits. The second main thesis is that the character of judges is central to Hume’s philosophy. Hume’s most sustained character of a judge is to be found in the essay ‘Of the Standard of Taste’. Close examination of this essay with particular attention to the character of the true judge reveals that such judges should not be conceived of as ideal, as some commentators on the essay have supposed. It is further argued that the true judge can be used, with some modifications, as a template for the moral judge, which Hume requires for his moral philosophy but never fully articulates. The two theses are mutually supporting in that the judges examined in accord with the second thesis are conceived of in terms of the first thesis, i.e. they are conceived of by Hume as characters constituted by heterogeneous elements. The first thesis receives support from the second thesis, as the reality of the elements supposed in the first thesis is undermined by a failure to appreciate the importance of judges as characters in Hume’s philosophy.

 "It was the worst of times; it was the worst of times" : popular prophecy, Rapture fiction, and the imminent apocalypse in contemporary American Evangelism	 Khalidi, Anbara Mariam	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2014	 This thesis explores how the Rapture fiction and popular prophecy of modern American premillennial dispensationalism shapes the eschatological beliefs of its readership. This will be accomplished through a text-based critical analysis of the anxiety narratives of the Bible study and exegetical guides of the Tim LaHaye Prophecy Library, and its counterpart, the Left Behind fiction series. This thesis represents the first scholarly analysis of the Tim LaHaye Prophecy Library, and the first situation of Left Behind fiction within its theological context. It will be proposed that these two sets of texts shape the eschatological beliefs of their readers through a discursive ‘streamlining’ that is performed in several ways. Firstly, the historical development of the movement will be examined, exploring the evolution of a specific premillennial dispensationalist hermeneutic and its ‘channelling’ through particular cultural institutions. Secondly, an analysis of the Tim LaHaye Prophecy Library and Left Behind fiction will demonstrate that this premillennial dispensationalist hermeneutic is almost exclusively communicated through anxiety narratives which focus on expressions of horror, isolation, powerlessness and paranoia. It will be argued that these narratives serve to explore ‘abjective’ elements of premillennial dispensationalist belief, re-integrating them into the fabric of the faith. Particular attention will be paid to these abjective elements, which include the role of the eschatological body, the nature of individual salvation, and the perpetual deferment of the Rapture. As such, the popular media of premillennial dispensationalism serves as a further channel for the discursive streamlining of the movement’s prophetic scheme. Finally, this thesis proposes that the ‘deprivation’ theory of millennial appeal does not adequately explain the appeal and success of premillennial dispensationalism. As such, the following analysis will suggest that an alternate critical analysis of the movement, concentrating on its tropes of anxiety, serves to better explain the continued appeal of this ideology.

 An examination of Max Scheler's phenomenological ethics	 Wigmore, Stephen R.	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	2015	 This thesis examines the little-known phenomenological ethical theory of Max Scheler, discussed in his Formalism in Ethics and Non-Formal Ethics of Values and The Nature of Sympathy, also bringing in various other complementary philosophers. It argues that Scheler’s theory, when supplemented with complementary ideas, is superior to those offered by contemporary analytic intuitionism and other meta-ethical theories. It argues that a theory of pluralist emotive intuitionism provides a better description of both our experience of ethical value and the logical requirements for the ethical knowledge presumed by that experience. This thesis places Scheler’s theory in the context of ethical intuitionism up until the present. It considers why intuitionism has been generally rejected, looking at outstanding philosophical questions facing ethical intuitionism and previous attempted answers, and discussing current theories of analytic ethical intuitionism and their flaws. It explains the significant elements of Scheler’s ethical theory and how it can be understood in its phenomenological context. To demonstrate how Scheler’s material intuitionism is better than current theories of rationalist intuitionism, and other meta-ethical alternatives, this thesis looks at two main groups of issues. Firstly, the epistemological issues raised by Scheler’s theory and how it offers a possible solution to the problem of ethical knowledge, along with a brief consideration of ontological issues. Secondly, normative issues raised by Scheler’s theory: major issues on normative judgement raised but not answered by Scheler’s theory and, following this, a chapter dedicated to Scheler’s theory of ‘persons’, particularly with reference to Emmanuel Levinas. It concludes that an adapted Scheleran theory of ethical intuitionism can be superior to contemporary theories. It explains how the fundamental features of ethical experience may be epistemologically and phenomenologically justified based on objective values. It provides better responses to standard problems raised against intuitionism while also providing a natural explanation for a wider range of moral phenomena than standard meta-ethical alternatives. This demonstrates its superior explanatory power and provides strong arguments for its value as an over-arching meta-ethical theory.	 Thesis or dissertation	 B Philosophy (General)	694601	1
 Ockham's conception of logic as a rational science : an inferentialist interpretation	 Vaughan, Nicolás	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2013	This thesis is a detailed examination of the logico-semantic system propounded by the English philosopher and theologian William of Ockham (c.1287 – c.1347). It provides a reinterpretation of Ockham's account of mental content and mental-language semantics, as well as of his theory of consequential goodness. It does so from the standpoint of an inferentialist theory of meaning, in rejection of previous attempts made from the standpoint of internalist and externalist theories of mental content. Chapter 1 ('The Scientic Status of Logic') provides an account of Ockham's understanding of logic as a rational, practical, ostensive science. Chapter 2 ('The Received Interpretation') presents and casts doubt upon the arguments put forward by the defenders of both externalist and internalist construals of Ockham's semantic theory. Chapter 3 ('An Inferentialist Construal') presents the central tenets of a inferentialist theory of meaning. In order to show how Ockham's system can be understood within such a semantic paradigm, we will have to set out at least three things. First, Chapter 4 ('Ockham's Propositionalism') argues that the mature Ockham actually embraced a propositionalist theory of meaning. Second, Chapter 5 ('Obligationes and the Normativity of Asserting') seeks to prove that such a theory of meaning can only be properly understood against the normative background provided by his theory of obligationes. Finally, Chapter 6 ('Consequences') argues that Ockham's theory of consequential goodness is materialist, not formalist. That is to say, that the goodness of a certain kind of consequence ultimately depends upon the meaning of its propositional parts, rather than upon its structure. It is then shown that all remaining kinds of consequences (syllogisms included) are to understood with respect to these material inferences. The main sources of this research are Ockham's Ordinatio, his Summa logicae, and his Quodlibeta septem. As regards the inferentialist theory of meaning, Robert Brandom's Making it Explicit (1994) and Wilfrid Sellars 'Inference and Meaning' (1953) were essential to this research.

 Desire and value in practical reasoning	 Fossey, Peter	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	2014	 Intentional actions are those which are performed because the subject sees something tobe said for performing them; the subject sees performing the action “in a positive light”. Intentional actions are therefore susceptible to a distinctive kind of explanation, which explains them as intentional; that is, which accounts for them in terms oftheir unique property, of being performed because the subject sees that there is something to be said for doing so. Practical reasoning is the process of figuring out what there is reason to do; that is, what actions are best supported by the considerations available to the subject. To put it another way, practical reasoning is the process of figuring out which actions there is the most to be said for; so practical reasoning explains intentional action “properly”, i.e., in terms of its special properties. Many philosophers, loosely following the lead of David Hume, have argued for a close connection between desire and intentional action. If desires explain intentional actions properly, then they must do so through practical reasoning; that being the case, how do they do it? Another sizeable group of philosophers, the anti-Humeans, have argued that desires cannot explain intentional actions properly; they claim that desires are not the right sorts of things to appear in the premises of arguments, do not count in favour of any action, do not constitute evaluations of any action, and are in any case too fickle and lawless to take part in distinctively normative forms of explanation. The central question in this thesis is, what is the role of desire in practical reasoning? I put forward a characterisation of desire which explains how some desires can explain intentional actions properly, and leaves the question open whether all intentional actions are properly explained by desires.

 Philosophy and the facetious style : examining philosophy as method in the works of Gillian Rose	 Hammond, Naomi Felicity	 University of Winchester	 University of Southampton	2002	 It is the claim of this thesis that central to any reading of the work of Gillian Rose is an understanding of her development of Hegel's thought. This thesis accordingly examines Rose's work through a comprehensive reading of Hegel contra Sociology. It is argued that an irresolvable aporia is discovered at the heart of Rose's reading of Hegel which, this thesis argues, manifests itself through the question and answer of style. It is argued that Rose simultaneously undermines the presupposition of style and at the same time reinforces it. It is also argued that this is consistent with Rose's acknowledgment and critique of prevailing social relations. It is argued in conclusion that Rose's work is both simply an expression of aporia which undermines the question of style and at the same time is itself also aporetic which thus reinforces the question of style.

 The question of being : Heidegger and beyond	 Wolfendale, Peter	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	2011	The project of this thesis is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the question of Being posed by Heidegger, to identify problems with Heidegger's formulation of the question, and ultimately suggest a way in which these problems can be overcome. The analysis begins by laying out Heidegger's initial attempt to formulate the question presented in Being and Time and the work immediately following it. The real concern here is to get clear about the constraints Heidegger places upon the formulation of the question, and how these structure the inquiry projected in his early work. This focuses on the importance of the question of the structure of questioning in relation of Being, and the status of the question as a question of meaning. This involves examining the origins of the question in Aristotle, and providing a detailed account of Heidegger's theory of meaning and interpretation. The thesis then examines the way in which this initial formulation of the question evolves during the 1930's, moving from the meaning to the truth of Being. This involves providing a detailed account of Heidegger's theory of truth and the way this develops after Being and Time. After this, the thesis moves on to assess Heidegger's attempts to formulate the question in relation to the constraints just outlined. This reveals several insurmountable problems in both Heidegger's later approach, and a number of serious problems with his earlier approach, the worst of which undermines the very aim of the project. The thesis concludes by showing that there are resources for overcoming this within the way that Heidegger's approach develops after Being and Time, once this development is understood in terms of Heidegger's account of metaphysics. This leads to the outline of an alternative formulation of the question.	 Thesis or dissertation	 BD Speculative Philosophy	560113	1
 Spectra, form and morphology : the appropriation of phenomena in the work of Tristan Murail	 Byron, John	 University of Northampton	 University of Northampton	2007	The French composers Tristan Murail (b.1947) and Gerard Grisey (1946-98) are the two chief originators of “Spectral Music”, an approach to composition that developed in France from the mid-1970s, and which is characterised by the ‘spectrum’, a conception and codification of sound as a collection of individual, related partials, realised by orchestral synthesis. While the composers’ exploitation of the physical characteristics of sound, based on technological analysis, is well documented, Murail has drawn analogies throughout his mature work with other phenomena, including those associated with electroacoustic means of sound treatment and production, morphologies found in the earth’s surface (both land and water) and recently developed scientific paradigms (chaos theory and fractal geometry). In Murail’s most recent works, the complex properties of sound samples are used as compositional models. The application of these analogies is diverse, ranging from the use of relatively simple algorithms to the formation of elaborate structures that possess a highly evocative and metaphorical mode of communication. The use of inharmonic sounds, or “noise”, in particular, evokes nature and places the work in a particular relationship with the world. The thesis investigates the appropriation of phenomena by analogy through analysis of key compositions. While research focuses on Murail, the work will be contextualised alongside that of Grisey, and within Spectral Music in general, in order to gain a greater critical understanding of the music	 Thesis or dissertation	ML3800 Philosophical and societal aspects of music ; ML430 Composition and performance ; ML385 Biography	545836	1

 Cartographies of subjectification	 Brassett, Jamie D.	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	1992	 The project of this thesis is multi-faceted. Starting with an examination of Kant's First Critique, it outlines the inextricable linkage between our understanding of subjectivity and a notion of space. Once such a connection has neen made, it describes the approach necessary to reorient the notions of space and subjectivity that have culminated in the postmodern cry that The Subject is Dead. This approach is named, "Cartography" and is borne out of an examination of the works of Bachelard, Deleuze and Guattari. Given the bases of the area of study, and the way that it will be studied, the next move made in this thesis is to examine the possible and desired outcomes of such an approach. Thus, from reading both Deleuze and Guattari, we will see that a Cartography will reorient that which constitutes subjectivities in such a way as to disable any effort of oppression, and it will redefine our understanding of the space constitutive of these subjectivities as a material one. In a single phrase, then, this thesis can be described thus: To provide for an understanding of a material space and vectors of subjectification, in a way that enhances their mutual construction, so that the active formation of the two can destroy that which organises the subjective oppression currently experienced.

 Soviet epistemologies and the materialist ontology of poor life : Andrei Platonov, Alexander Bogdanov and Lev Vygotsky	 Chehonadskih, Maria	 Kingston University	 Kingston University	2017	This thesis provides new perspectives on the epistemic conditions of pre- and post-revolutionary Soviet thought (1910s–early 1930s) and constructs a transdisciplinary entry point into a materialist ontology of ‘poor life’. The concept of poor life engages contemporary debates on class composition and individuation from the materialist viewpoint of self-organising labour causality and social mediation. The thesis opens with a critical examination of the ‘Western’ and ‘Eastern’ divide in Marxist philosophy and shifts discussion from the official doctrine of Bolshevism to the under-represented epistemologies of Empirio-Marxism and Spinozist- Hegelianism in the philosophy and political theory of Alexander Bogdanov, the writings and art criticism of Andrei Platonov and the experimental philosophy and psychology of Lev Vygotsky. A transdisciplinary, post-revolutionary logic assumes that theory should start where Marx ended and that it should act in a Marxist fashion across all conceptual and practical realms. The reconstruction of these epistemological conditions leads to an alternative philosophical genealogy of Soviet avant-garde art and the writings of Andrei Platonov. The thesis explores the connections between the Empirio-Marxism of Bogdanov and the problematic of construction, ‘life-building’ and production in the theories of the Soviet avant-garde. Bogdanov proposes an organisational ontology of the active and productive capacity of labour to compose and construct historically determined ‘life-complexes’ and orders of material relations. In turn, the organisation of sensibility, things and relations, or communist ‘life-building’, becomes the primary theoretical and practical agenda of Proletkult, Constructivism, Productivism and the Literature of Fact. The thesis demonstrates the unique place of Andrei Platonov within these conceptual settings. The core of the thesis is a reconstruction of Platonov’s method and form of writing, the aim of which is to demonstrate the conceptual reciprocity of the problems of ‘lifebuilding’ and ‘poor life’. Platonov stresses the negativity of partition and compartmentalisation within the compositional logic of ‘life-building’. In the experience of social poverty, the selforganising force of labour produces a disjunctive unity of thinking and speech, reaction and act, time and space. Vygotsky’s Spinozist-Hegelianism exposes the structural logic of this negativity. The reconstruction of his system shows how mediation produces a dialectical dramaturgy of individuation out of the compositional materiality of poverty and the given ensemble of social relations. The thesis concludes by outlining a differential unity between the three authors. The Soviet problematisation of poor life links social and ontological degrees of organisation, offering epistemological models of compositional productivity and of the individuating negativity of ‘life-building’. The epistemic conditions that we reconstruct in the thesis may have vanished along with their revolutionary context, but they are likely to resurface in the course of any new experiment in radical social transformation.

 Nothing : Kant's analysis and the Hegelian critique	 Gungor, Tolga	 University of Essex	 University of Essex	2017	 This thesis aims to throw an illuminating light on the as yet neglected concept of nothing in Kant’s system, a concept which is taken into consideration, by Kant, in accordance with the guiding thread of the categories of the understanding. My main argument is that Kant has a fourfold division of nothing and each has a transcendental function in his system. This function is basically a limiting one; setting up negative determinations without which Kant’s system would have never been constituted as it is now. It is shown in the thesis that the concept of nothing is divided basically into four: first, nothing as ens rationis that limits and thereby protects knowledge, secondly nothing as nihil privativum that defines the boundaries of phenomenal reality, thirdly nothing as ens imaginarium that makes possible the unity of experience and finally, nothing as nihil negativum that draws the lines of logical thinking. All make, in the last resort and by being the concepts of the opposite, experience possible. The thesis consists of four chapters. The first chapter is an exposition of all four divisions of nothing, the second is the display specifically of the concepts of ens rationis and nihil negativum, and the third is of the concepts of ens imaginarium and nihil privativum. The auxiliary argument of the thesis is that while Hegel makes a strong charge of externality against and thereby severely criticizes the Kantian concept of the thing-in-itself, - the concept of which I propose to be contained under the concept of ens rationis- Kant has equally convincing arguments against such a charge. This is the topic of the fourth and final chapter which has an implicit aim of creating the image of a powerful critical Hegel but on the other hand an equally enduring and war-like Kant. Kant is presented as a philosopher who has powerful responses to institute a balance between himself and his opponent. When Kant’s differing concepts of nothing are taken into account, Hegel’s attack of externality, it is maintained, appears not to have taken into account the full measure of the resources of the Kantian position. Even when it is said that the attack is against one specific concept of the thing-in-itself alone, Kant still seems to have enough resources for toleration and defence indeed.

 Moral luck : control, choice, and virtue	 Woodford, Nicole Frances	 University of Hull	 University of Hull	2016	 In this thesis I propose a solution to the problem of moral luck. It is sometimes assumed that luck has no bearing on morality. However, Bernard Williams and Thomas Nagel, in their papers entitled ‘Moral Luck’, show how this assumption could be erroneous. When making moral judgements it is usually thought that we abide by the ‘Control Principle’. This principle requires any moral judgements about an individual to be made only in cases where they were in control of their actions. The problem of moral luck arises because many moral judgements appear to contradict the Control Principle. My aims in this work are two-fold. First, I disambiguate concepts of luck and moral luck by conceptualising both in light of a Hybrid Account of Luck (HAL). In order to understand moral luck, the concept of luck itself needs to be understood. I begin by distinguishing luck from similar concepts and go on to defend a particular version of HAL that can be adapted to identify genuine cases of moral luck. Second, I propose a possible solution to the problem of moral luck based primarily on a critique of some of Nagel’s basic presuppositions regarding the issue in conjunction with a defence of Terence Irwin’s interpretation of Aristotle’s complex theory of moral responsibility. By giving a number of examples, I hope to establish that there is circumstantial moral luck and resultant moral luck, and that Aristotle’s conditions for moral responsibility can provide an adequate justification for praise and blame in these cases.

 Levinas : subjectivity, affectivity and desire	 Wilde, Anthony Edward	 University of Hull	 University of Hull	2013	 The thesis argues that Emmanuel Levinas’s later concept of ethical subjectivity, explicated in his late work Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence, can really only be understood by taking into account the very early work On Escape. The thesis argues that the concept of ethical subjectivity emerges from his work via his attempts to articulate transcendence. Transcendence itself is ultimately identified with ethics. My thesis traces his continued attempts at a satisfactory conception of transcendence through the early works (Existence and Existents and Time and the Other), and via his other major work Totality and Infinity. On Escape articulates a very specific notion of need in terms of a need for escape which forms the conceptual seeds of Levinas’s idea of transcendence, and which will ultimately become his notion of metaphysical Desire. His notion of ethics as the arresting of the spontaneous ego’s conatus by the face of the Other, will turn out to ultimately requires the articulation of ethical subjectivity. The notion of ethical subjectivity is made possible, and thus his work reaches maturity, by the introduction of the notion of the trace. I argue that the idea of subjectivity as openness and vulnerability and the notion of an otherwise than being can be traced to the early work. My thesis takes as its starting point Levinas’s engagement and criticism of the philosophy of Martin Heidegger. I argue that Levinas can best be understood as always in some sense in conversation with Heidegger.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	612683	1
 The art of Platonic love	 Lopez, Noelle Regina	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2014	 This is a study of love (erōs) in Plato’s Symposium. It’s a study undertaken over three chapters, each of which serves as a stepping stone for the following and addresses one of three primary aims. First: to provide an interpretation of Plato’s favored theory of erōs in the Symposium, or as it’s referred to here, a theory of Platonic love. This theory is understood to be ultimately concerned with a practice of living which, if developed correctly, may come to constitute the life most worth living for a human being. On this interpretation, Platonic love is the desire for Beauty, ultimately for the sake of eudaimonic immortality, manifested through productive activity. Second: to offer a reading of the Symposium which attends to the work’s literary elements, especially characterization and narrative structure, as partially constitutive of Plato’s philosophical thought on erōs. Here it’s suggested that Platonic love is concerned with seeking and producing truly virtuous action and true poetry. This reading positions us to see that a correctly progressing and well-practiced Platonic love is illustrated in the character of the philosopher Socrates, who is known and followed for his bizarre displays of virtue and whom Alcibiades crowns over either Aristophanes or Agathon as the wisest and most beautiful poet at the Symposium. Third: to account for how to love a person Platonically. Contra Gregory Vlastos’ influential critical interpretation, it’s here argued that the Platonic lover is able to really love a person: to really love a person Platonically is to seek jointly for Beauty; it is to work together as co-practitioners in the art of love. The art of Platonic love is set up in this way to be explored as a practice potentially constitutive of the life most worth living for a human being.

Metaphysics in educational theory : educational philosophy and teacher training in England (1839-1944)	 Berner, Ashley Rogers	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2007	In 1839 the English Parliament first disbursed funds for the formal education of teachers. Between 1839 and the McNair Report in 1944 the institutional shape and the intellectual resources upon which teacher training rested changed profoundly. The centre of teacher training moved from theologically-based colleges to university departments of education; the primary source for understanding education shifted from theology to psychology. These changes altered the ways in which educators contemplated the nature of the child, the role of the teacher and the aim of education itself. This thesis probes such shifts within a variety of elite educational resources, but its major sources of material are ten training colleges of diverse types: Anglican, Nonconformist, Roman Catholic, and University. The period covered by this thesis is divided into three broad blocks of time. During the first period (1839-1885) formal training occurred in religious colleges, and educators relied upon Biblical narratives to understand education. This first period also saw the birth of modern psychology, whose tools educators often deployed within a religious framework. The second period (1886-1920) witnessed the growth of university-based training colleges which were secular in nature and whose status surpassed that of the religious colleges. During this period, teacher training emphasized intellectual attainment over spiritual development. During the third period (1920-1944), teachers were taught to view education from the standpoint of psychological health. The teacher's goal was the well-developed personality of each child, and academic content served primarily not to impart knowledge but rather to inform the child's own creative drives. This educational project was construed in scientific and anti-metaphysical terms. The replacement of a theological and metaphysical discourse by a psychological one amounts to a secular turn. However, this occurred neither mechanically nor inevitably. Colleges and theorists often seem to have been unaware of the implications of their emphases. This thesis contemplates explanatory models other than the secularisation thesis and raises important historical questions about institutional identity and the processes of secularisation.

 Challenging the orthodox view of human rights	 Hussey, Stephen Henry	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2015	 The concept of human rights holds a distinctive significance in political practice, yet philosophers remain divided over the nature of these rights. The Orthodox View defines human rights as moral rights possessed by all individuals simply in virtue of their humanity. Proponents of this view claim that the contemporary idea of human rights is a continuation of the natural rights project of the eighteenth century and shares many of its basic philosophical assumptions. This thesis argues that the Orthodox View is no longer an appropriate characterisation of the concept of human rights we find in current domestic and international practice. It also rejects recent alternatives offered by supporters of the Political View, who define human rights by particular functions they serve, specifically their role(s) in acting as benchmarks for the legitimacy of states or triggers of international concern. I propose instead a new 'Political Justification View' of human rights, which states that human rights are demands which challenge unjustifiable political-institutional orders, which are the concern of all people, and which protect the equal standing of individuals in political decisions that affect the collective or individual good. This view better captures the diversity of practices that employ the term 'human rights', whilst also explaining its innovative power as a moral language that enables individuals to challenge the official institutional order under whose authority they live. Finally, I argue that within this broader view of human rights there are two distinct moral concepts which pertain to different parts of human rights practice: Domestic Human Rights and International Legitimacy Rights. Separating these two concepts is helpful in resolving long-standing debates about whether human rights are properly thought of as minimalist moral concerns of legitimacy or broader social goals to be achieved through political institutions.

 The philosophy of tragedy : the tragedy of philosophy : the mimetic interrelationship of tragedy and philosophy in the theoretical writings of Friedrich Hölderlin	 Chapman, Helen Christine	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	1992	This study investigates Phillipe Lacoue-Labarthe's claim in "The Caesura of the Speculative" that Hölderlin is a "modern" writer. Its aim is to establish what is at stake in this claim and to evaluate whether it can be substantiated. In Chapter One I discuss the relationship between tragedy and philosophy. I show that the uneasy relationship between philosophy and the arts is premised upon Plato's understanding and judgement of mimesis. I contrast Plato and Aristotle's treatment of poetry by examining how they understand the mimetic process. In Chapter Two I focus on Hölderlin's understanding of the relationship between Ancient Greece and 18th Century Germany. After discussing the background to Hölderlin's work I provide detailed readings of two texts, The Perspective from which We Have to Look at Antiquity, (1799) and the first letter to Böhlendorff, dating from 1801. I argue that in these texts Hölderlin, through his acknowledgement of the divided nature of Greek culture, offers a unique understanding of the relationship between Greece and Germany which isolates him from his contemporaries. In Chapters Three and Four, I examine Hölderlin's understanding of tragedy. After establishing the centrality of the aesthetic presentation for Hölderlin's project I examine the "poetological" writings which date from 1798-1800. I give a close analysis of the implications of Hölderlin's statement that the tragic "is the metaphor of an intellectual intuition" which occurs in the text On the Difference of the Poetic Modes, (1800), showing why the tragic form is central to Hölderlin's poetological project. To illustrate the problems inherent in this project, in Chapter Four I examine Hölderlin's attempts to write a tragic drama which corresponds to his theoretical beliefs. I discuss the two theoretical texts - The Ground to Empedocles and Becoming in Dissolution - which accompany Hölderlin's drama Empedocles. In analysing these texts I argue that there is an inherent tension between the presuppositions of the theory and the way they can be realised in the drama. In Chapter Five, I turn to Hölderlin's final work, his project to translate Sophocles' tragedies. Through close analysis of the theoretical Remarks which accompany the translations, I show how Hölderlin's theoretical and poetological interests in Greece and Tragedy are brought together through this project. I argue that these texts give an insight into the problems which confront Hölderlin's poetological project. However, simultaneously, these texts provide an alternative way of understanding the function of the tragic form. In this discussion I show how the questions concerning the status of dramatic mimesis and the "mimetic" relation between Greece and Germany coincide in the analysis of Sophocles' dramas. In conclusion I return briefly to the questions that I raised in the introduction concerning the status of tragedy in the present time, and assess the accuracy of the claim that Hölderlin is a "modern" thinker.

 Action cause and volition	 Sen, Jharna	 Royal Holloway, University of London	 University of London	1972	 The aim of the thesis is to defend the view that mental entities like wants, desires etc., can be the causes of actions. In the introduction the problem of causal explanation of action is introduced, together with the main outline of the views of different philosophers who are opponents of the causal theory of action. It includes a short introduction to the arguments produced by the opponents of the causal theory of action, and an outline of the project of the thesis. Chapter I is concerned with the question as to whether causal explanation is synonymous with mechanical explanation. In this connection R.S. Peters' view is discussed Chapter II is concerned with the traditional theory of volition as a causal explanation of action. In part I, the question of whether all actions are preceded by an act of will is discussed in the context of G. Ryle's criticism of the concept of volition. In part II, the question of the empirical identifiability of an act of will is discussed, together with the views of W. James, G.N.A. Vesey and R.A. Imlay on the matter. Chapter III consists of the defence of the view that wants, desires etc., can be the causes of actions. In Chapter IV the question of the indescribability of desires, wants etc., without reference to actions is discussed with special reference to A.I. Melden. Chapters V and VI sure concerned respectively with the Humean contention that a cause must be an event, and that a causal explanation needs a generalisation. Chapter VII concentrates on the question whether reason-action statements are incorrigible and therefore not causal. In conclusion, I have given a short summary of the outcome of the various arguments discussed in the thesis.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	704201	1

 Material culture : an inquiry into the meanings of artefacts	 Holt, Timothy James Peter	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	1996	 The main purpose of the following inquiry is to emphasise the importance of a phenomenon long neglected by the majority of the human sciences, the artefact; each one of us, no matter what age, sex or culture, is in contact with artefacts every moment of our lives yet despite this they have received scant attention. The study begins by outlining a definition of the artefact, highlighting those characteristics which, in combination, ensure its centrality to social life before, through a discussion of Popper's ideas, proceeding to see how material culture can be conceptualised as meaningful. In order to understand how meaning becomes attached to the artefact the notion of objectification will be analysed and, consequently, so shall the importance of both the type of activity and the physical nature of the materials involved in the artefact's production. Picking up on the theme of materiality this aspect of material culture will be shown to pose major problems to any interpretation of the artefact along semiological lines; language and material culture are evinced to possess fundamentally distinct characteristics which make comparisons between them far from straightforward. These differences will be analysed further, concentrating specifically on the role of context in the establishment of meaning. This leads on to the proposal that our understanding of artefacts can occur on three levels; three forms of knowledge are thus described of which a linguistically formulated type constitutes just one kind. The penultimate chapter tackles the ways in which artefacts affect us, how they are active elements in our relationships with them; therefore, a dialectical position is postulated in which both artefacts and agents take part. Finally, the study concludes by stressing some of its wider implications and suggests a few of the practical situations to which it can be applied.

 The dynamics and communication of concepts	 Prosser, Simon James	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	2001	 The central claim of this thesis is that concepts, the components from which cognitively significant truth evaluable content (thought) is composed, are unstructured entities an account of whose individuation makes no essential reference to other concepts in the possession of the thinking subject or to any particular means by which the reference of the concept is identified by the thinking subject. This position is called Conceptual Atomism and contrasts with Inferential Role Semantics, according to which concepts are individuated by their inferential roles or their conditions of warranted application. The structure of the argument is as follows. Firstly, a principle called the Transparency Principle is developed. This places constraints on the individuation of concepts across differing contexts. The Transparency Principle is then used to show that Inferential Role Semantics is false because it cannot provide a satisfactory account of cognitive dynamics; that is, of the conditions under which a concept is retained through changes in the epistemic state of the subject over a period of time. A version of Conceptual Atomism is then defended and it is shown that this theory yields the correct individuation of concepts. According to this theory the concepts of an individual subject are individuated in terms of referential episodes, episodes of ongoing reference to an object or property during which it is diachronically transparent to the subject that the same thing is being referred to. The more general notion of a referential practice is then used to account for the sharing of concepts by more than one person. Finally, a novel account of the thoughts expressed using indexical terms is defended in order to show that indexicals present no counterexample to Conceptual Atomism. This account of indexical thoughts is of some consequence in its own right.	 Thesis or dissertation	 B Philosophy (General)	251069	1
 To each according to deeds : divine judgement according to deeds in second temple Judaism and in Paul's letters	 Yinger, Kent L.	 University of Sheffield	 University of Sheffield	1996	 Paul's use of the motif of 'judgment according to deeds' corresponds terminologically, rhetorically, and theologically with its use in second temple Judaism. In order to demonstrate this thesis, the author examines the tradition- history of the motif in the Jewish Scriptures, the OT Pseudepigrapha, and the Qum- ran literature. By the beginning of the common era 'judgment according to deeds' is a widespread, fundamental theological axiom, applicable to a variety of rhetorical purposes. The motif has an important soteriological function within what is now commonly termed Jewish 'covenantal nomism' (not legalism). This judgment does not entail a one-for-one recompense of good or evil deeds, but views works wholistically (i.e., as a whole either good or bad), and thus as revealing one's 'way' of life or 'heart'. One's deeds do not earn or merit God's grace and salvation; nevertheless, one's recompense-the blessings or the curses of the covenant-will be congruent with ("according to") this pattern of behavior, since one's works reveal what is hidden in the heart, either loyalty or disloyalty to God and his covenant. Salvation by covenant mercy and judgment according to works are complementary. In both its form and function Paul's use of the motif places him firmly within this same tradition-history. In addition, he maintains the wholistic perspective of deeds common to the Jewish tradition. Although the term 'covenantal nomism' is not appropriate for Paul's thought (Christ replaces the Torah as the defining locus of electing grace), the fundamental structure of grace and works, election and obedience, salvation and judgment, remains remarkably similar. In Paul also one is justified by grace and judged according to works, issuing in eternal life or wrath. The juxtaposition of justification and judgment causes Paul no theological tension, because he inherited a way of speaking and thinking about judgment according to deeds which similarly related them without paradox.

 The appeal of faith development theory : a sociological perspective	 Leach, Jane	 University of Nottingham	 University of Nottingham	1997	 This thesis seeks to examine James Fowler's faith development theory from a sociological perspective in order to understand the theory's appeal and function within mainstream British churches. Assuming that all claims to knowledge articulate the interest of a particular social group, the thesis begins by outlining the intellectual tradition in which faith development theory stands and then examines its social base within Britain. Insights from the sociology of knowledge and the social psychology of religion are used to suggest that faith development theory operates as a theory of identity amongst those to whom it appeals, acting as a legitimising framework for those of a post-liberal theological outlook who work within the context of religious diversity. Looking at these dynamics in operation through the results of a questionnaire and an examination of relevant literature, it is concluded that faith development theory functions amongst church leaders who are constructing a post-liberal identity, as a framework for interpreting their own faith experience and that of those to whom they must relate. Finally, we consider the implications of this perspective upon faith development theory for pastoral theology, suggesting that studies of the social effects of Fowler's stages of faith, such as this one, form an important element in the theological assessment of faith development theory, and raise crucial questions about the kind of strategies for the maintenance of Christian identity which are appropriate in the post-modern world.

 The role of imagination in Bergman, Klein and Sartre	 Williams, Daniel	 Brunel University	 Brunel University	2013	This thesis provides an inter-disciplinary study of selected works by Ingmar Bergman. I explore how key concepts from Melanie Klein and Jean-Paul Sartre apply to the focus on characters in a state of heightened imagination; and the value placed on imagination in the construction of these films. This involves recognition of the way an active response from the viewer is encouraged. Klein, Sartre and Bergman also attend to contextual factors that challenge any notion of subjectivity as sovereign and the power of imagination is frequently placed in a social context. All three figures develop their ideas within specialised fields drawing on the influence of others. Chapter 2 shows how Klein’s ideas relate to the influence of Freud before exploring how her work can be applied to Bergman’s films through the example of Wild Strawberries. Chapter 3 concentrates on Sartre’s early work, The Imaginary and considers how this is significant in relation to some of Sartre’s better-known philosophical ideas developed during and after the Second World War. These ideas will lead to an exploration of The Seventh Seal. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 focus on three films from distinct parts of Bergman’s career: Summer with Monika, The Virgin Spring and Hour of the Wolf. In Chapter 4 this will be preceded by a brief over-view of three more films from the early part of Bergman’s career. These chapters explore how Kleinian and Sartrean ideas can be incorporated in close analysis, and alongside selected critical responses to the films. The analysis integrates key points from Klein and Sartre in a methodology specific to film studies. This will include analysis of cinematic elements such as camera work and lighting, and recognition of narrative structure and character development	 Thesis or dissertation	 Film ; Psychoanalysis ; Philosophy ; Aesthetics ; Culture	571801	1

 Saying nothing : in defence of syntactic and semantic underdetermination	 Bowker, Mark	 University of St Andrews	 University of St Andrews	2016	 According to the Encoding Model, speakers communicate by encoding the propositions they want to communicate into sentences, in accordance with the conventions of a language L. By uttering a sentence that encodes p, the speaker says that p. Communication is successful only if the audience identifies the proposition that the speaker intends to communicate, which is achieved by decoding the uttered sentence in accordance with the conventions of L. A consequence of the Encoding Model has been the proliferation of underdetermination arguments, each of which concludes against some linguistic theory T, on the grounds that, were T true, audiences would be unable to know what was said by utterances of some particular linguistic form, and therefore unable to know what speakers intended to communicate by these utterance. The result, if we accept the conclusion of these arguments, is radical restriction of the domain of viable linguistic theory. This Thesis defends an alternative model according to which there need be nothing encoded in an uttered sentence – nothing that is said by its utterance – for the audience to retrieve. Rather, there are indefinitely many ways to interpret uttered sentences – indefinitely many routes to the propositions that speaker intend to communicate – which proceed through different interpretations of what is said.

 Pattern recognition in astrophysics and the anthropic principle	 Darg, Daniel W.	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2012	 The role of the Anthropic Principle in astrophysics and cosmology is examined in two principal parts. The first (minor) part takes a chiefly philosophical perspective and examines the manner in which human cognition features into discussions on cosmic origins. It is shown that the philosophical questions raised by the Anthropic Principle and ‘fine-tuning of life’ bear resemblances to problems within the philosophy of mind and we seek a common origin for this surprising parallel. A form of ‘epistemic structural realism’ is defended and used to critique the physicalist identity thesis. It is argued that equating ‘reality’ with mathematical structures, which is the basis of the identity thesis, leads to incoherent conclusions. Similar reasoning is used to critique infinite Multiverse theories. In the second (major) part, we gradually transition into mainstream astrophysics, first presenting a new line of research to explore counterfactual universes using semi-analytic models (SAMs) and offering a preliminary study wherein the cosmological constant is varied and the effects on ‘advanced civilisations’ are examined. The importance of galaxy mergers is highlighted and leads to their study. We first try solving the pattern-recognition problem of locating mergers using the Galaxy Zoo database and produce the largest homogenous merger catalogue to date. We examine their properties and compare them with the SAMs of the Millennium Simulation finding good general agreement. We develop the Galaxy Zoo approach with a new visual-interface design and double the size of the merger catalogue of SDSS mergers in the local Universe.

 The character of theology : Herman Melville and the masquerade of faith	 Johnson, Bradley A.	 University of Glasgow	 University of Glasgow	2006	My task in this thesis is to assess the theological implications of Herman Melville’s aesthetic understanding of the modern Subject as a duplicitous self-creation. Although Melville is obviously not a theologian, either by discipline or confession, I will argue we find in the complex theatricality of his life and fiction a means of articulating the potential of a truly radical theological thinking. Such a thinking, I argue, ‘unthinks’ all previous grounds, in order then to recast them imaginatively. For Melville, we shall see, that which identifies theology ‘as theology’ is not simply an unattainable, transcendent Thing-in-Itself. It is, on the contrary, the active emergence of unthinkable excess from the materialistic immanence of its self-characterisation. The aesthetico-theological thinking in view here highlights the necessity of a repositioning of theological discourse from the binary perspective that inevitably leads to self present identification, be it in a discipline or a confession, to the radically decentered / desacralized interdisciplinarity of theology becoming-itself. I seek to achieve this end by situating Melville close to the Germanic philosophical climate that was sweeping across the American literary landscape of the mid-19th century. Melville’s ambivalent attitude toward his own desire for self-destruction, and thus, too, his desire for a non-subjective common pool of artistic genius, is strictly parallel to his misgivings about Transcendentalism and Romanticism. It is, I argue, in the dialectical materialism of Friedrich Schelling that we find Melville’s philosophical analogue, in their respective efforts to understand the self-becoming of the Absolute / God / Truth. Here we find an aesthetico-theological thinking attuned to the creative inadequacy of self-becoming, whereby the finite inadequacy and perspectival duplicity of theological self-presentation carry the potential of a self-creativity that makes all things new. As such, for aesthetico-theological thinking there is truly nothing behind or beyond the materiality of experience - i.e., no Ding an sich or transcendental determination of being. And precisely for this reason the awareness and actualisation of something new, indeed something miraculous because it was previously impossible, is made possible.

 Christ as the telos of life : moral philosophy, athletic imagery, and the aim of Philippians	 Arnold, Bradley	 University of Exeter	 University of Exeter	2013	The aim of Paul’s letter to the Philippians has been understood in various ways: e.g. reassurance, consolation, advance of the gospel. This thesis presents a new analysis of Philippians that challenges these proposals and offers a new way of thinking about Paul’s overarching argumentative aim in this letter. After demonstrating the need to examine three areas (viz. moral philosophy, athletics, and vivid speech) in an historical analysis of Philippians and addressing methodological issues pertinent to this investigation (Part I), I turn to map out the historical context relevant for this project (Part II): viz. the broad structure of thought in ancient moral philosophy, ancient athletics and its association with virtue, and the use of vivid description to persuade an audience. The final part of this thesis (Part III) is an exegetical analysis of Philippians that interprets the letter in light of the contextual material discussed in Part II, exploring how this contextual material contributes to and is interrelated in Paul’s persuasive appeal to morally form the Philippian Christians in a particular way. In this analysis I argue that Paul’s pattern of thought in Philippians is structured similarly to the broad structure of thought in ancient moral philosophy, which is oriented toward an ultimate τέλος and views the virtues as necessary in attaining this goal. Paul’s use of athletic language, framing his argument in the letter (1:27–30; 4:3), fills out this perspective on life by presenting the nature of Christian existence in terms of a contest of virtue, which is similar to how moral philosophers used this language. This perspective on life is vividly depicted and summed up in the image of the runner in Phil 3:13–14. As a vivid description this imagery would have had a powerfully persuasive effect and rhetorically plays a significant role in Paul’s argument. With this imagery, Paul is presenting himself as striving toward Christ, the τέλος of life, which entails thinking and living in a particular way to make progress toward this goal—the final attainment of which is complete transformation to become like Christ. It is this vivid description of the runner that encapsulates Paul’s overarching argumentative aim in the letter, persuading the Philippians to pursue Christ as the τέλος of life.

 Formal structures of sensory/perceptual experience	 Müller, Benito	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	1990	This thesis deals primarily with metaphysical issues concerning human sensory/ perceptual experiences, and with questions about the formal representation of these experiences. In this respect it is similar to N. Goodman's The Structure of Appearance, which is discussed at some length. I establish a way of des- cribing and formally representing certain structures which must occur in sensory/ perceptual experiences, regardless of how the features of these experiences are categorized in terms of being physical or being mental. A special ("ontological- ly neutral") conceptual scheme which reflects the neutrality with respect to these categorizations, and which is particularistic in the sense of admitting sensory/per- ceptual individuals (sensations), is introduced for this purpose. The choice of a particularistic conceptual scheme in this context is supported by an argument which shows that the so-called adverbial approach is insufficient for describing sensory/perceptual experiences. To achieve the desired formal representation, I introduce an original generalization of the standard formalism for semantic 1st -order predicate theories which involves incomplete models, and a type of structured primitive predicates. Based on a Kantian view of the function of concepts in experience, I then give an account of experiential colour-predicates (like x looks red) in ontologi- cally neutral terms. This account, involving a special class of sensory/perceptual individuals (colour-tokens), has the particular advantage of avoiding the short- comings of both sense-datum theories and the views held by C. Peacocke in Sense and Content. This is followed by an account of experiential intentionality (in ontologically neutral terms) which shows how intentionality, as occurring in the context of sensory/perceptual experiences, can have a relational nature, des- pite the well-known problems of substitutivity and intentional inexistence which are traditionally associated with intentional relations.

 Heidegger's early ontology and the deconstruction of foundations	 Jovejoy, James Grant	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	1992	This dissertation is a polemical exegesis of Heidegger's 1920's position with respect to the foundational, extracting from his thought an original pre-conception of the foundational which does not conform to current patterns of Heidegger interpretation. This might be expressed as a rescuing of foundations from metaphysics. The first half of the dissertation concentrates on methodological idiosyncracies in the semantic, syntactic and macrostructural organisation of foundational ideas, an analysis which begins to yield a number of "patterns" embedded in the language and thinking of Heidegger, patterns which, for example, subvert the propositional and reverse the normal processes of understanding. These patterns are "paratypes", the tools of "disas-sembling" (the latter term describes that in Heidegger's thought which provides the original motivation for the later development of deconstruction). The second half of the dissertation applies and extends these findings in two directions: firstly, with respect to the internal development of the Sein und Zeit project, by exploring the coalescence of temporality and foundations; secondly, with respect to the direction and fate of the Sein und Zeit project, by exploring a limited number of "foundational" aspects (fugue, Kehre, Abgrund, Ereignis) of a single but singularly important writing from the 1930's: Beiträge zur Philosophie. In so doing the dissertation aims to bring out the Copernican thought-revolution in the early work, and to provide both the conceptual motivation and the methodological tools for a more farreaching reappreciation of Heidegger's early work. Thus the dissertation has consequences, not only for the foundational, but also for the language-thought problematic, for the possibility of overcoming metaphysics, for Heidegger's general development, and for the appraisal of the position of time in his work.

 Nietzsche on epistemology and metaphysics	 Doyle, Tsarina	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	2002	 This thesis examines Nietzsche's philosophy as a response to Kant. I show that Kant, as interpreted by Nietzsche, dissociates epistemology and metaphysics. According to Nietzsche, the consequence of this dissociation is the collapse of Kant's transcendental epistemology into a sceptical idealism, which disables the making of positive metaphysical claims about the nature of reality. I argue that Nietzsche overcomes the dissociation of epistemology and metaphysics by rejecting Kant's distinction between constitutive, empirical knowledge and regulative, metaphysical belief. Furthermore, I show that Nietzsche rejects, what he considers to be, Kant's formalistic constitutive epistemology in favour of a regulative and interest-directed account of knowledge. I argue that Nietzsche adopts an internal realist epistemology that stipulates that our epistemic claims must be justified from within our perspectival practices of justification but that such claims must be subject to a realist constraint. Moreover, I propose that Nietzsche is justified, from within these epistemic parameters, in putting forward metaphysical claims about the nature of reality. The thesis is structured in four chapters. Chapter one examines Nietzsche's appropriation of Kant. Chapter two takes up the issue of Nietzsche's perspectivism in the context of his concerns with the issues of justification and truth. The penultimate chapter examines the emergence of Nietzsche's internal realism in his early writings. Finally, chapter four examines Nietzsche's will to power thesis where I contend that the metaphysics of the will to power is both facilitated by and compatible with his perspectivism.

 Trajectories of Peircean philosophical theology : scriptural reasoning, axiology of thinking, and nested continua	 Slater, Gary	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2015	The writings of the American pragmatist thinker Charles S. Peirce (1839-1914) provide resources for what this thesis calls the “nested continua model” of theological interpretation. A diagrammatic demonstration of iconic relational logic akin to Peirce’s Existential Graphs, the nested continua model is imagined as a series of concentric circles graphed upon a two-dimensional plane. When faced with some problem of interpretation, one may draw discrete markings that signify that problem’s logical distinctions, then represent in the form of circles successive contexts by which these distinctions may be examined in relation to one another, arranged ordinally at relative degrees of specificity and vagueness, aesthetic intensity and concrete reasonableness. Drawing from Peter Ochs’s Scriptural Reasoning model of interfaith dialogue and Robert C. Neville’s axiology of thinking—each of which makes creative use of Peirce’s logic—this project aims to achieve an analytical unity between these two thinkers’ projects, which can then be addressed to further theological ends. The model hinges between diagrammatic and ameliorative functions, honing its logic to disclose contexts in which its theological or metaphysical claims might, if needed, be revised. Such metaphysical claims include love as that which unites feeling with intelligibility, hell as imprisonment within an opaque circle of interpretation whose distorted reflections render violence upon oneself and others, and the divine as both the center of aesthetic creativity and outermost horizon from which our many layers of interpretive criteria emerge. These are claims made from a particular identity in a particular cultural context, but the logical rules upon which they are based are accessible to all, and the hope of the model is to help people overcome problems of interpretation and orient themselves toward eternity without ignoring the world around them.

 The paradox of exploitation : a new solution	 Ferguson, Benjamin	 London School of Economics and Political Science (University of London)	 London School of Economics and Political Science (University of London)	2013	 In this thesis I present a rights-based theory of exploitation. I argue that successful conceptions of exploitation should begin with the ordinary language claim that exploitation involves `taking unfair advantage'. Consequently, they must combine an account of what it means to take advantage of another with an account of when transactions are unfair. Existing conceptions of exploitation fail to provide adequate accounts of both aspects of exploitation. Hillel Steiner and John Roemer provide convincing accounts of the unfairness involved in exploitation, but because they fail to provide restrictive `advantage taking' conditions, their theories of exploitation include cases that we would not ordinarily describe as exploitations. Ruth Sample and Robert Goodin provide accounts that place a stronger emphasis on the attitudes involved in exploitation and the processes that bring it about. Unfortunately, these theories do not properly incorporate the unfairness aspect of exploitation. Consequently, they are either self-frustrating or incomplete. I provide a conception of exploitation that combines both aspects.	 Thesis or dissertation	 B Philosophy (General)	587459	1

 Discourse on the question of incompletion	 Leyshon, Benjamin	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	2001	 This study presents a discourse on the question of incompletion and simultaneously inaugurates the development of a critical approach to contemporary social and political questions concerning selfhood, thought and community in terms of incompletion. Such a strategy has taken place on two main levels in this work. Firstly, there is a close textual reading and analysis of texts where the question of incompletion has been engaged with. Secondly, there is a historical/social analysis of existing institutions, this is a secondary analysis of how the United Nations can be conceived in terms of completion or incompletion in relation to the quest for community. A major part of the close textual reading deals with French post-structuralist writers such as Bataille, Derrida, Foucault and Jean Luc Nancy. These writers are of interest in this work to the extent that they think central problematics of the philosophical tradition as necessarily and unavoidably incomplete. An important tension in the work of these writers is explored by showing that they theorise the central concepts of the self, thought and community as being impossible to resolve in any reachable present and yet they also do not abandon these central problematics either. The theoretical task entails bridging the gap between the deconstructive and the constructive, the nihilistic and the utopian within poststructuralism itself, and this, paradoxically, is to attempt an agitated reconciliation. Such a reconciliation may only act to deepen the difficulties to be found within the thought of such writers, but the theorization of incompletion does ultimately seek to both comprehend and critique contemporary difficulties surrounding the questions of community and selfhood.

 Revelation in history in the theologies of Charles Hodge and Karl Barth	 Lazenby, Henry F.	 University of Aberdeen	 University of Aberdeen	1982	 This study is a comparison between the views of two Reformed theologians, Charles Hodge and Karl Barth, concerning revelation in history. It is an attempt to contrast their different viewpoints in the light of their assumptions about knowledge and their understanding of theology. There is also an attempt to place each man within his particular historical context and to determine how his historical circumstances affected the formulation of his theological beliefs and epistemological assumptions. For Charles Hodge, knowledge of God is similar to the knowledge of the external world. He believed there was a natural understanding of God given through natural revelation and that was supplemented by the understanding obtained from the information provided in the Bible, God's supernatural revelation. He believed theology should be primarily concerned with the study of the Bible. This study of the Bible should take the form of a systematizing of the timeless truths found in the Bible in order to formulate a definitive confession of faith that gives the correct interpretation of God Himself and His dealings with man. From this framework, Hodge presented revelation in history as the communication of timeless truths about God, man and the world. In natural revelation, truths were communicated through the interaction of the innate facts of consciousness with the external world. In supernatural revelation these truths were give by inspiration as the Holy Spirit chose and controlled certain people to communicate the truths that God wanted to be made known to the world. In the case of the Biblical writers, they were chosen and controlled to communicate these truths in written form. They were controlled to such an extent that the words themselves were inspired and gave these truths in an error-less way. For Barth, knowledge of God is different from knowledge of the external world. This is because of the radical difference between God and His creation. Revelation in history is God's unveiling of Himself in man's time. In this unveiling, God speaks His Word and gives man knowledge of Himself. Through this unveiling, a person is able to affirm the truth and reality of God Himself as He was made known in His original unveiling in Jesus Christ. In His original unveiling in Jesus Christ, God made Himself known to man by becoming a man Himself. Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Incarnate Word of God and demonstrates the truth and reality of God Himself in His person and work. The Bible and Church proclamation are witnesses to this revelation of God in Christ and the means through which God unveils Himself in the present age. God unveils Himself by speaking His Word through the written word of the Bible and the spoken or written word of Church proclamation. Theology is the self-examination of the Church in the light of this self-revelation of God in Christ. As a result of this comparison, the difference between the two theologians in relation to their views on revelation in history becomes apparent. Whereas Hodge believes revelation in history is the communication of natural and supernatural truths that gives man a set of timeless truths to be systematized and accepted as the correct interpretation of God, man, and the world, Barth believes revelation in history is the unveiling of the truth of God Himself as He speaks His Word to man through His Son, Jesus Christ, and through the witness of the Church.

 Equality and global justice	 Ip, Ka-Wai	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2012	This dissertation aims to defend an egalitarian conception of global distributive justice. Many hold that the scope of egalitarian justice should be defined by membership of a single political community but my dissertation will challenge this view. I begin by considering three distinctive arguments against the ideal of global equality. They maintain that egalitarian obligations of justice apply only to those people who are subject to the same sovereign authority which coerces them to abide by its rules; or to those who contribute to the preservation of each other’s autonomy through collectively sustaining a state; or to those who belong to the same nation. The first three chapters deal with these arguments respectively. Central to these arguments is the assumption that the domestic and the global contexts are different in some morally relevant way so egalitarian principles of justice apply to the former but not the latter. After rebutting these anti-egalitarian arguments I turn to the more constructive task of developing a form of global egalitarianism that is grounded in the value of equality as a normative ideal of how human relations should be conducted. I argue in Chapter 4 that relational equality—that is, standing in relations of equality to one another (rather than relations characterized by domination or exploitation)—is a demand of justice in the global context. This ideal of relational equality has distributive implications. In Chapter 5 I try to spell out these implications by defending a set of principles of global distributive justice that would follow from our commitment to global relational equality. In the sixth and final chapter, I discuss what responsibilities we have in relation to global injustice, how to distribute the burdens associated with these responsibilities, and whether they are excessively demanding on complying agents.

 The materialist interpretation of John Millar's philosophical history : towards a critical appraisal	 Smith, Paul B.	 University of Glasgow	 University of Glasgow	1998	 This dissertation examines aspects of John Millar's philosophical history in order to provide grounds for a critical appraisal of the content of his contribution to social and historical science. Using Millar's published books and lectures in civil law as primary sources, it is suggested that Millar applied an empiricist method to the principles of jurisprudence. Millar shared this method with Hume and Smith. Implicit within the method was the abstraction of an ideal observer or spectator. This abstraction was derived from the use of an empiricist method to understand the operations of the minds of particular individual subjects on the pre-determined experience of immediate circumstances. The method assumed that the operations of subjects' minds on the objects of their experience included classification, comparison, generalisation, conjecture, inference, imaginative identification and experiment. Millar's method is therefore characterised as both conjectural and individualistic. Through a critique of Ronald Meek's seminal statements on Millar's materialism, certain issues are investigated for further critical appraisal. These include Millar's political economy, his conception of civil society, and his political theory. It is argued that Millar had a conception of generalised commodity production and exchange; that this conception was derived from the assumption that subjects are self-interest; and that the latter assumption was necessary to explain the origins, emergence and development of civil and political society. Millar assumed that individuals' pursuit of self-interested goals gave rise to ideas of positive law, freely alienable property, different distributions of property, and feelings of liberty. It is suggested that Millar's theorisation of the effect of the latter on forms of government is derived from a combined use of Smith's principles of authority and utility with Hume's commercialised Harringtonianism.

 A class act : class and taste in the work of Grayson Perry	 Walsh, Susan Jane	 University of Hull	 University of Hull	2016	Part One (Chapters 1-3) discusses the theoretical and historical development of our ideas about class and the intersections of class and taste. Part Two (Chapters 4-8) focuses on Perry’s work. Chapter One explores the differing conceptions of class that are used in contemporary theorising to form a background to my discussion of the role of class in the work of Grayson Perry. Chapter Two looks at models of class: the way in which class has been imaged/imagined in both the popular and political imaginary. The social imaginaries of class are an important context for the discussion of Perry, for his work makes use of and reinvents these models. This chapter also discusses how the language of meritocracy has shaped political policy and influenced how people perceive social mobility. In Chapter Three the focus is on class and taste with specific reference to Bourdieu’s work Distinction: A social critique of the judgement of taste (1986). Bourdieu’s thesis draws attention to the way in which the exercise of taste (both in art and in the realm of everyday life) functions to reinforce and legitimate existing social divisions. Here, the aim is to highlight the way in which Bourdieu’s theory can throw an illuminating light on Perry’s position, as expressed in his Reith Lecture series and elsewhere and in his artistic practice. Taken together these chapters provide the context for the detailed discussion of Perry and class in Part Two of the thesis. The chapters that make up Part Two are as follows. Chapter Four provides a biography of Grayson Perry. These details about Perry’s early life are important because it is here that we find the foundations of his future success as an artist. This chapter also discusses a selection of Perry’s pots. Chapter Five discusses Perry’s exhibition Unpopular Culture (2008). Based on a detailed discussion of selected exhibits my aim is to show that although Perry’s work is not explicitly political, it does carry an implicit politics of class. The influence of Walter Benjamin is important here. Benjamin recognized that ‘culture’ was not an ‘independent realm of values’ that gave representation to the nation as a whole. His aim was to find images that revealed ‘…the bald economic determination of existence’ (Benjamin, 1999, p: 43). I argue that we can find this same political sensibility in Perry’s approach. Many of the photographs in this exhibition reveal how class is an objectivist category anchored in material and social conditions. Perry’s decision to define his role as an artist-ethnographer enables him to make work that is responsive to his subjects. Chapter Six focuses on Perry’s television documentary series All in the Best Possible Taste (2012) in which we accompany the artist as he travels to the different regions of Britain to find answers to the question of what people like and why. The answers he elicits to this apparently simple question form the basis for his tapestry series The Vanity of Small Differences (2012). Chapter Seven presents a detailed analysis of the six tapestries that make up The Vanity of Small Differences (2012). Taken together these tapestries reveal the ways in which class is both made and unmade through culture. Chapter Eight presents a discussion of Perry’s exhibition entitled Who Are You? The fourteen portraits that made up the exhibition were on show at the National Portrait Gallery in 2014. These works were also the culmination of a three-part documentary series Grayson Perry: Who Are You? Perry said that during this research he wanted to speak to people on a more individual level and to hear their personal stories. Here the focus was not ostensibly on class identity but on ‘modern British identity in all its complexity and diversity’ (Brown, 2015). But as we shall see, these complex identifications are always criss-crossed by class differences, not least because as Perry himself acknowledges, class ‘does so inhabit you’ (Perry 2016). This statement reveals what really lies at the heart of Perry’s art and his politics.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	721523	1
 A reasonable objectivism for aesthetic judgments : towards an aesthetic psychology	 Schellekens, Anna Elisabeth	 King's College London (University of London)	 King's College London	2003	 This doctoral thesis is an examination of the possibility of ascribing objectivity to aesthetic judgements. The aesthetic is viewed in terms of its being a certain kind of relation between the mind and the world; a clear understanding of aesthetic judgements will therefore be capable of telling us something important about both subjects and objects, and the ties between them. In view of this, one of the over-riding aims of this thesis is the promotion of an ‘aesthetic psychology’, a philosophical approach, that is to say, which emphasises the importance of the psychological processes involved in the making of aesthetic judgements. One of the aims of this thesis is to develop a revisionary account of the distinction between objectivity and subjectivity in the domain of value. This revision will undertake to dismantle some of the assumptions implicit in a metaphysical framework which traditionally ascribes objectivity only to judgements about facts, and not to judgements about values and other concerns such as norms and emotions. Further, the thesis examines the intricate ways in which aesthetic properties, the focus of aesthetic judgements, depend on the (emotional and other) responses of the subjects of experience. The particular role played by first-hand experience in the making of aesthetic judgements is among the things critically investigated in the interests of reaching a clearer understanding of the manner in which aesthetic judgements may be objective in the sense of being justifiable. Eventually, a defence is outlined of the view that aesthetic judgements can be supported by good reasons, but not in the same way as ordinary cognitive judgements. Finally, I outline the main tenets of a proposed ‘reasonable objectivism’ for aesthetic judgements, an objectivism grounded on justifying reasons.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	406872	1
 Some uses of Plato in Achilles Tatius' Leucippe and Cleitophon	 Repath, Ian Douglas	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	2001	 The aim of this thesis is to explore the relationship between Achilles Tatius' novel Leucippe and Cleitophon and the Platonic corpus. I have searched for Platonic allusions of various natures and purposes and grouped them into thematic chapters. I have also compared instances of similar uses of Plato in contemporary authors in order to classify both the individual cases and the place of Achilles Tatius' novel in its literary environment, including the intended readership. In my introduction I have argued that through the combination in his works of philosophy and literary excellence Plato was an extremely important figure to the Greeks of the second sophistic. However, despite the increasingly influential opinion that Greek novel readership was not dissimilar to that of other works, the possibility that the Greek novelists used Plato in a more than cosmetic fashion has been relatively neglected. The uses of Plato on which I have concentrated are the employment of Platonic names as allusions to their namesakes; Platonic narrative technique as the model for the dialogue form and open-endedness of Leucippe and Cleitophon with the integration of this technique into the broader question of the discrepancies between the beginning and the end; the allusion to a particularly famous passage of the Phaedrus in the name of the heroine; the repeated allusions to the Phaedran flow of beauty, their purposes and the light they shed on the characterisation of Cleitophon; and the Phaedran scene-setting, indulged in by many other writers, which Achilles Tatius uses in two significant passages. The conclusions I have reached are that Achilles Tatius uses Plato far more extensively and imaginatively than hitherto realised; that such an intimate engagement can shed light on other issues, such as psychological characterisation and the question of humour; that Achilles Tatius wrote something of an "anti-Platonic" novel; and that his work displays many similarities with other works whose sophistication is less in doubt.

 Can a gospel convey truth? : an examination of the epistemology of New Testament hermeneutics with special reference to the Gospel of St Mark	 Papaphilippopoulos, Rosalind	 University of Aberdeen	 University of Aberdeen	1996	 This thesis explores the hermeneutical implications of a Barthian epistemology, so that the givenness (of knowledge, ontology, talk of God and Scripture, the community of the Church) is paramount. This priority challenges both 'liberal' despair and fundamentalist arrogation of true reference to theological language and appropriate Biblical interpretation. This hermeneutical position also faces the postmodern challenge that there can be any truth at all, and, in particular, truth brought through the deconstruction of textuality as a medium. Thus knowledge, and especially knowledge of God, the language used to communicate that knowledge and that language as Scriptural textuality are important features of the discussion. There is an exploration of the role of inter-subjectivity (and thus community) as a prerequisite for knowledge and truth claims, critical assessment of these, and a discussion of the different ways that various 'communities' interpret Scripture (focusing on St. Mark's Gospel). The presuppositions of the different starting places are brought into view and the appropriateness of methodologies and approaches discussed. Questions regarding certainty and critical control of this community-generated variety of readings are tackled. The Quest for the Historical Jesus is seen as a 'test case' for historical knowledge and also the need and appropriateness of different approaches to the Gospels. The 'problem' that the Resurrection and post-Easter faith always seem to pose to the Quest is challenged and the former is taken as a priority rather than a stumbling block.

 Being art - a study in ontology	 Weh, Michael	 University of St Andrews	 University of St Andrews	2007	 I present and defend a two-category ontology of art. The basic idea of it is that singular artworks are physical objects, whereas multiple artworks are types of which there can be tokens in the form of performances, copies, or other kinds of realisations. I argue that multiple artworks, despite being abstract objects, have a temporal extension, thus they are created at a certain point of time and can also drop out of existence again under certain conditions. They can, however, not be perceived by the senses and cannot enter into causal relations. The identity of an artwork is determined by its structural properties, but also by the context in which it was made. The essential contextual properties of an artwork are those that are relevant to the meaning of the work. A realisation of a multiple artwork has to comply with the structure of the work and has to stand in the correct intentional and/or causal-historical relation to the work. Realisations that diverge too much from the structure of the work, like translations of literary works, are what I call “derivative artworks”. I argue against the thesis that all artworks are multiple. I claim that there are singular artworks, and some of them are even necessarily singular. I show why certain standard arguments against the idea that all artworks can be realised multiple times are flawed, and present my own theory about what decides whether a work is singular or multiple, namely that successful intentions of the artist determine which category an artwork belongs to. Concerning singular artworks, I also investigate what the relation between the work and the matter it is made of is, and how a work can survive a change in its parts and still remain the same work.

 Rules, reasons, and acceptance	 Perry, Adam Drew	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2012	 In law as well as in ordinary life, it matters what rules societies have; but what does it mean for a society to have a rule? HLA Hart’s famous answer is that for a society to have a rule is for there to be a certain social practice in that society, consisting of an external, behavioural aspect and an internal, attitudinal aspect. Hart’s ‘practice theory’ dominates thinking in jurisprudence about social rules, but, I argue, there are serious problems with it. It would be better to adopt what I call the ‘acceptance theory’. In the early chapters of this thesis, I argue that the practice theory is both overinclusive and underinclusive. It is overinclusive because Hart’s description of the ‘internal aspect’ is too general. It is underinclusive because the ‘external aspect’ is unnecessary. Once these criticisms are taken into account, what remains of the practice theory is the idea that a society has a rule because its members have a certain attitude. I spend much of this thesis determining the features of this attitude. Ultimately, I focus on the attitude known as “acceptance” in the philosophy of action. Acceptance of a proposition simulates belief in that proposition, though it may be held independently of that belief. I argue that a person or society has a rule when that person, or that society’s members, accept that some action ought to be performed, whatever their beliefs about the matter. This theory incorporates the plausible core of the practice theory, while avoiding its problems.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Legal philosophy ; Rules ; acceptance ; reasons	650288	1

 Living without why : an exploration of personal Muslim authenticity	 Trevathan, Stephen Davis	 University of Birmingham	 University of Birmingham	2014	This work aims to look into the question of authenticity and inauthenticity within the Muslim discourse. How muslim can Muslims really be? Within the Muslim world the concept of authenticity is usually coupled with questions of adherence to the canonical and historical. Despite the fact that the Qur’an addresses the individual in a very direct manner, little emphasis seems to be focused on personal authenticity within contemporary Muslim circles. Muslim societies are understood to be communally based with less emphasis on the individual (Lewis : 2007) and yet inner searching has been very much a part of Muslim culture though this may now have shifted significantly in engaging with, what is argued here, as the increasing mundanization (Drane : 2000) and rationalist approaches to religion generally and specifically to Islam. This work sets out to explore what, if any, inauthenticities have arisen within the Muslim discourse that might have given rise to this. In attempting to think through these questions, various contemporary manifestations of global management culture are explored, the development of rationality within Muslim intellectual history and contemporary theological positions within Islam are brought up for examination. Throughout these enquiries any resulting connection with inauthenticity and rationalism is sought out. Has this management paradigm reached the religious sphere? Has there been a McDonaldization of Islam? How can these be effectively countered? Much of the analysis and discussion that takes place is through a dialectical perspective between classical Islamic and existentialist thought. One of main aims of this research is to demonstrate ways of thinking through to potential personal authenticity despite the obstacles mentioned.

 How to be a scientific realist (if at all) : a study of partial realism	 Peters, Dean	 London School of Economics and Political Science (University of London)	 London School of Economics and Political Science (University of London)	2012	 "Partial realism" is a common position in the contemporary philosophy of science literature. It states that the "essential" elements of empirically successful scientific theories accurately represent corresponding features the world. This thesis makes several novel contributions related to this position. Firstly, it offers a new definition of the concept of “empirical success”, representing a principled merger between the use-novelty and unification accounts. Secondly, it provides a comparative critical analysis of various accounts of which elements are "essential" to the success of a theory, including structural realism and the divide et impera strategy. A novel account of essentialness, entitled the “empirically successful sub-theory "account", is defended. Thirdly, it is argued that the realism/anti-realism debate should put to the side metaphysical questions and focus instead on partial realism's commitment to the continuity of science. Because this commitment lacks metaphysical implications, it is referred to as "deflationary realism". Anti-realists cannot reject deflationary realism as a matter of a priori principle; its overall viability (and therefore that of partial realism) can therefore only be assessed by a careful examination of the history of science. Finally, another consequence of partial realism, named "partial rationalism", is defended. Partial rationalism states that, in cases where several competing theories have been suggested, scientists are rational just in case they accept the essential elements of each of the scientific theories on offer. This novel position subverts the existing literature on scientific "revolutions", as it sometimes demands that scientists devise a synthesis between competing scientific theories, instead of "choosing" only one. The philosophical points defended in this thesis are illustrated and supported by case studies from the history of science, including Fresnel’s wave theory of light, the Copernican revolution, the "neo-Darwinian synthesis" in evolutionary biology, the "prion revolution" in molecular biology, the miasma theory of disease, and the chemical revolution.

 Informed consent and respect for autonomy	 Scott, John	 University of Sunderland	 University of Sunderland	2007	 In this thesis I examine the medical concept of informed consent and the philosophical concept of autonomy in conjunction with the relationship between them. This examination is complicated because autonomy can refer to decisions or persons. Further autonomy may have instrumental or intrinsic value. These differences mean autonomy may be respected in different ways. This examination is further complicated because whilst a vast wealth of medical literature exists on informed consent and mentions autonomy, very little of this literature does more than mention autonomy. As a result of my examination I argue for the following. Firstly I argue the form of autonomy underlying informed consent should be personal autonomy and to respect autonomy means accepting autonomous decisions. Secondly I show in certain contexts a surrogate decision maker cannot make a decision on behalf of an incompetent patient that would be generally agreed to be in his best interests. I will argue in such contexts a patient’s decision should always be accepted as the concept of competence becomes detached from the concept of informed consent. Thirdly I show a patient may make an autonomous decision based only on understanding the purpose of the procedure he is consenting to. I will argue it follows a patient should not be required to understand details of the nature of the procedure he is consenting to for his consent to be accepted. Fourthly I argue an autonomous decision must be one an agent identifies with and has some persistence. I will show these conditions are satisfied by an autonomous agent’s absence of restlessness to change his decision Lastly I argue informed consent decisions should be linked to a patient’s ability to understand the risk involved in his decision and not directly linked to the degree of risk involved in his decision.

It is found that, while Luke's view of Jesus' prayer-life is similar, he makes a distinctive contribution to NT ch Furthermore, Luke intimates by means of his redaction throughout the gospel, and states explicitly through his use of Stephen's vision in Acts 7:55-56, that Jesus prayed in this life as the heavenly Intercessor come to earth; he now continues to.

 The God of possibility and promise : Christian eschatology as a response to technological futurism	 Burdett, Michael Stephen	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2012	 The explosive growth of technology today is causing extensive speculation about the future. These ‘technological futurisms’—especially transhumanism—are often imbued with religious value by their adherents. How should Christians respond to the content of technological futurisms and also the way the future is constructed? In this thesis I argue that Christian eschatology has a more robust understanding of the future than technological futurism, as championed by transhumanism, and can allow for radical hope while also maintaining important humanistic virtues which are ultimately lost in transhumanism. Christian eschatology does not only depend on what is actual to create its future. Rather, it is open to the God of possibility and promise who can bring the radically new in the Kingdom of God. This dissertation is broken into three major sections with an introductory and concluding chapter. The first section provides a history of our technological imagination today by looking at visionary approaches to technology and the future in both technological utopias and science fiction. This history provides the conditions for understanding the proposed future of transhumanism. The second section orients the final response by assessing technology and the future in the eschatologies of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and Jacques Ellul. Both Teilhard and Ellul agree that the technological future without appeal to the Christian God is dangerous. The final section looks at the theological and philosophical issues surrounding technology and the future. Heidegger’s works are used to sharpen themes related to technology and the future; in particular, how technology is related to ontology and how the future is related to possibility. The final chapters construct a Christian response to transhumanism around the themes of possibility and promise by utilising the works of Richard Kearney, Eberhard Jüngel and Jürgen Moltmann. A Christian notion of possibility allows for the radically new in a way transhumanism does not and the Christian idea of promise safeguards human virtues by emphasising the interpersonal as ultimate rather than self-transcendence as with transhumanism.

 Inference and action : relating beliefs to the world	 Gonzalez De Prado Salas, Javier	 University of Southampton	 University of Southampton	2015	 The goal of this dissertation is to offer a practice-based account of intentionality. My aim is to examine what sort of practices agents have to engage in so as to count as talking and thinking about the way the world is – that is, what sort of practices count as representational. Representational practices answer to the way the world is: what is correct within such practices depends on the way things are, rather than (only) on the attitudes of agents. An account of representation must explain how such objective standards of correctness are introduced in human practices: one must explain how the world gets to have a say in what is correct in human discursive practices. Roughly, my proposal is that human discursive practices become responsive to the way things are by virtue of involving practical interactions with the world. The outcomes of these interactions depend on the way the world is and the evaluation of such outcomes contributes to determining which moves within the practice count as correct. Due to our practical engagement with the environment, thus, the world gets to constrain discursive practices. In order to flesh out my proposal, I develop a practice-based characterization of intentional or representational content. On this sort of approach, expressing intentional contents is seen as a matter of playing a certain role in relevant practices, rather than as a matter of engaging in some word-world relation. The expression of content, thus, is explained in terms of use. In particular, I adopt an inferentialist perspective, according to which discursive moves express contents because of their role in practices of giving and asking for reasons. I investigate how practical engagement with the environment introduces friction with the world in these practices of giving and asking for reasons. One of the main conclusions reached in the dissertation is that defeasibility is an essential feature of objective representational practices – so that attributions of representational correctness are revisable in an open-ended way. The discussion of defeasible reasoning – and of the way in which defeasibility shapes human representational practices – is a central point of this dissertation.

 Integration, ambivalence, and mental conflict	 Brunning, Luke	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2015	 In my DPhil thesis I critique a philosophical ideal of mental organization: that one’s mind ought to be integrated, that is, lack conflicts or ambivalence between mental states, because disintegration is argued to impair one’s agency and undermine one’s well-being. My argument has three parts. In part one, I describe Plato’s maximalist version of the ideal where, if ideally organized, one’s psyche lacks conflicts because one’s rational faculty, aware of what is valuable, harmonises one’s motivational and affective states. I also argue that any dispute about integration is orthogonal to the dispute between value monists and value pluralists. In part two, I contest the integration ideal by criticizing three manifestations of it in contemporary philosophy. I focus on the organization of desire, and on deliberative and affective ambivalence. My arguments have a similar structure. First, I challenge the link between the integrated mind and the purported benefits of unimpaired agency and well-being. On investigation, this apparent connection is largely contingent. Not all conflicts or ambivalence are harmful, and other social or psychological factors are relevant in case where they really are damaging. Secondly, I argue that there are contexts where integration is a form of mental rigidity or harmful impoverishment. Thirdly, I argue that being disintegrated seems morally good in some situations where one manifests fitting states of mind, particularly emotions. In part three, I ask whether integration can be reinterpreted to salvage an alternative ideal. After rejecting a promising candidate found in Kleinian psychoanalytic theory, I offer my own account of integration as a two-part capacity to tolerate difficult mental states (not necessarily bad mental states - excitement can be hard to tolerate), and to avoid being reflectively passive as one’s mental organization changes. This capacity has rational and non-rational elements. Finally, I consider how this reinterpreted capacity relates to the practice of virtue. I conclude that integration is not a virtue, and may be compatible with some viciousness, but it enables one to be virtuous in situations where there are pressures towards being insensitively singleminded.

 Inferences in context : contextualism, inferentialism and the concept of universal quantification	 Tabet, Chiara	 University of St Andrews	 University of St Andrews	2008	This Thesis addresses issues that lie at the intersection of two broad philosophical projects: inferentialism and contextualism. It discusses and defends an account of the logical concepts based on the following two ideas: 1) that the logical concepts are constituted by our canonical inferential usages of them; 2) that to grasp, or possess, a logical concept is to undertake an inferential commitment to the canonical consequences of the concept when deploying it in a linguistic practice. The account focuses on the concept of universal quantification, with respect to which it also defends the view that linguistic context contributes to an interpretation of instances of the concept by determining the scope of our commitments to the canonical consequences of the quantifier. The model that I offer for the concept of universal quantification relies on, and develops, three main ideas: 1) our understanding of the concept’s inferential role is one according to which the concept expresses full inferential generality; 2) what I refer to as the ‘domain model’ (the view that the universal quantifier always ranges over a domain of quantification, and that the specification of such a domain contributes to determine the proposition expressed by sentences in which the quantifier figures) is subject to a series of crucial difficulties, and should be abandoned; 3) we should regard the undertaking of an inferential commitment to the canonical consequences of the universal quantifier as a stable and objective presupposition of a universally quantified sentence expressing a determinate proposition in context. In the last chapter of the Thesis I sketch a proposal about how contextual quantifier restrictions should be understood, and articulate the main challenges that a commitment-theoretic story about the context-sensitivity of the universal quantifier faces.

 Re-thinking the extended mind : moving beyond the machinery	 O'Regan, John	 University of Hertfordshire	 University of Hertfordshire	2010	 Proponents of the Extended Mind Thesis (EMT) argue that the mind literally extends into the world because mental states literally extend into the world. But the arguments presented in favour of these claims are compatible with a much weaker conclusion, expressed as the Extended Machinery of Mind Thesis (EMMT) that secures only the extension of the enablers of mental states. What is required is a mark of the mental that can settle the constitutive versus enabling issue. Both sides of the debate accept non-derived content as a necessary condition on a state‘s being mental but this cannot settle the constitution versus enabling issue, meaning the debate has stagnated because there are no decisive moves left to make. Thus, the strongest move for the EM theorist to make is to reject non-derived content as the mark of the mental and seek an alternative. Because enactivism rejects the representational view of mind then if it can be made to work as an account of mentality it offers promise with regard to the formation of a new mark of the mental on which a genuinely interesting EMT can be based.

 Making a third place : the science and the poetry of husbandry	 Wood, Sandra Dawn	 Abertay University	 University of Abertay Dundee	2008	It locally contains or heaven, or hell; There’s no third place in’t. (Webster 1993) Husbandry in its original sense is a ‘being together’, based on dwelling in a particular place. There is an intricate connection between modern science and industrialised agriculture, both of which developed on the basis of particular values associated with Good Husbandry – those which focused on individual innovation, profit-related productivity, quantitative measurement, objective, ‘puritan’ truth and control of nature. Ideals of the earth as a ‘commonwealth’, and of traditional stewardship, were down-played. The writings of Francis Bacon provide an example of a positivist, pioneering attitude which has continued to underpin modern science. In retrospect, however, these ideals sound rather one-sided. Nature herself is not well represented in the modern science relationship. In this thesis, Virgil’s Georgics and Lucretius’ de rerum natura are used to derive a poetics of Being and of Husbandry, which applies not only to the world of poetry, but to events which underlie scientific research. Virgil’s use of verbs verifies that life’s activities are shared by all living things. Lucretius asserts that even inanimate atoms both exist in themselves and are creative. ‘To be’ can be visualised as a dynamic, balancing act between striving to stay in being and longing to engage creatively with another. The basis of this thesis is that a shaping of research towards good husbandry involves a fair relationship with nature, which in turn involves the acknowledgement in writing that nature is active, dynamic and a good collaborator. Husbandry defined as a continually unfolding third place between extremes or between self and other – this holistic, concentric definition – applies at all scales, all levels of experience. This work was derived from practice-led research involving the writing of poetry and therefore the findings exist in parallel as a sequence of poems.

 Property and welfare in liberal political philosophy	 Mayor, Jennifer Louise	 Middlesex University	 Middlesex Polytechnic	1984	 In Anarchy, State, and Utopia, Robert Nozick argues that only a minimal, nightwatchman state is morally justified because a state with more extensive powers "violates persons' rights not to be forced to do certain things". He writes that his view implies that the state may not justly compel "some citizens to aid others". It is the justification of compelling "some citizens to aid others" that is the subject of this dissertation. In arguing for his position, Nozick invokes the name and prestige of two foremost liberal philosophers, Locke and Kant. It is shown that these two philosophers to whom Nozick turns for support do not support him at all, for they, like other philosophers in the liberal tradition such as Mill and Reid, argue that the property rights of the affluent be limited to provide for the needs and welfare of those unable to do so for themselves, that the state may justly compel some citizens to aid others. It is possible that, while Nozick is not, as he believes, a true disciple of Locke and Kant, or, indeed, in the mainstream liberal tradition on this important aspect of distributive justice, he has, nevertheless, produced a theory of property rights that can stand on its own merits, without appeal to Locke and Kant. It is argued that this is not so either, that Nozick fails to give convincing arguments for his strong property rights. The rejection of the idea that redistribution is a legitimate sphere of state action did not originate with Nozick in the twentieth century. The idea is clearly expressed in the writings of Hume in the eighteenth century. In order to show more clearly the implausibility of the minimal state case, Hume's arguments against redistribution are investigated and shown to fail.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	292791	1
 Arguments for the existence of God in Anselm's Proslogion chapter II and III	 Lee, Myung Woong	 University of Glasgow	 University of Glasgow	1989	Anselm's argument for the existence of God in Proslogion Chap.II starts from the contention that 'lq when a Fool hears 'something-than-which-nothing-greater-can-be-thought', he understands what he hears, and what he understands is in his mind. This is a special feature of the Pros.II argument which distinguishes the argument from other ontological arguments set up by, for example, Descartes and Leibniz. This is also the context which makes semantics necessary for evaluation of the argument. It is quite natural to ask 'lq What is understood by the Fool, and what is in his mind? It is essential for a proper consideration of the argument to identify the object which is understood by the Fool, and so, is in his mind. A semantics gives answers to the questions of 'lq What the Fool understands? and 'lq What is in the Fool's mind? If we choose a semantics as a meta-theory to interpret the Pros.II argument, it makes an effective guide to identify the object. It is a necessary condition for a proper evaluation of the Pros.II argument to fix our universe of discourse, especially since, in the argument, we are involved in such talk about existing objects as Anselm's contention that 'when a Fool hears 'something-than-which-nothing-greater-can-be-thought', he understands what he hears, and what he understands is in his mind. The ontology to which a semantic theory commits us will be accepted as our scope of objects when we introduce our semantic theory to interpret the Pros.II argument, and this ontological boundary constrains us to identify the object in a certain way. Consistent application of an ontology, most of all, is needed for the evaluation of the logical validity of an argument. If we take Frege's three-level semantics, we are ontologically committed to intensional entities, like meaning, as well as extensional entities. Sluga contends that Frege's anti-psychologism for meanings should not be interpreted as vindicating reification of intensional entities in relation to Frege's contextualism, that Frege's anti-psychologism with his contextualism is nothing but a linguistic version of Kantian philosophy for the transcendental unity of a judgement. There is, however, another possible interpretation of Frege's contextualism. According to Dummett, the significance of Frege's contextualism must be understood as a way of explanation for a word's having meaning. If Dummett's view is cogent, we could say that Frege's contextualism does not prevent our interpreting his semantics as being committed to intensional entities. We need not worry that Frege's over all semantics, especially with his contextualism, would internally deny the ontological interpretation of his theory. We see Anselm's argument for the existence of God in Pros.II is an invalid argument if we introduce Frege's three-level semantics, i.e. if we acknowledge meanings of words as entities in our universe of discourse. We can also employ extensional semantics for the interpretation of the Pros.II argument. According to extensionalists, like Quine and Kripke, we need not assume intensional entities, like meaning, to be part of our ontological domain. They argue that we can employ our language well enough without assuming intensional entities. If we choose extensional semantics as a meta-theory to interpret the Pros.II argument, it commits us only to extensional entities as objects in the Universe of our interpretation. In Sections 1.4 and 1.5, I show that extensional semantics makes the Pros.II argument a valid argument for the existence of God. 'lq Necessary existence is the central concept of Anselm's argument for the existence of God in Proslogion Chap.III. It has been said that, even if the argument is formally valid, it cannot stand as a valid argument for the existence of God, since 'lq necessary existence is an absurd concept like 'lq round square. And further that even if there is a meaningful combination of concepts for 'lq necessary existence, it cannot quality as a subject of an a priori argument. As objections to the interpretations which make the Pros.III argument valid, it has been argued that even if there is a concept of 'lq necessary existence which is meaningful and there is another concept of 'lq necessary existence which is suitable as a subject of an a priori argument, there is no concept of 'lq necessary existence which is meaningful and at the same time suitable as a subject of an a priori argument. In Chap.2 and Chap.3, I try to show that there can be concepts of 'lq necessary existence which are proof against these objections. Anselm's arguments for the existence of God in Proslogian Chap.II and Chap.III are logically valid arguments on some logical principles. Some fideists, K. Barth, for example, argue that Anselm's arguments for the existence of God in Proslogion are not proofs for the existence of God even if they are logically valid arguments. I raise the question how this attitude could be possible, in Chap.4 and Chap.5. Barth's fideistic interpretation of Anselm's Proslogion arguments does not find any flaw in the validity of the arguments, and it accepts the meaningfulness and truth of the premises even to the fool in Proslogion. If this is the case, i.e. if Barth's interpretation accepts the validity of the arguments and the truth of the premises, I raise the question, how can the arguments not be interpreted as proofs for the existence of God? How is it possible that the function of the arguments is not that of proving the existence of God? According to Wittgensteinian fideism, premises in the arguments should not be intelligible to those who do not believe in God's existence already, and so the real function of the arguments is the elucidation, the understanding of believer's belief, rather than proving articles of belief to unbelievers. Barth's fideistic interpretation of the arguments, however, fully recognizes the meaningfulness and truth of the premises in the arguments as well as the validity of the arguments. I argue that there could be a justification for the Barthian fideism. As Malcolm notices, there are still atheists who understand Anselm's arguments as valid, but the only possibility for the people who recognize the validity of Anselm's arguments still to remain atheists has been thought to be to challenge the truth of premises employed in the arguments. Now, of the atheistic possibility, we can change the direction of our attention, that is, to the question about the function of a logically valid argument itself. What has not been thought of in relation to Anselm's arguments is the significance of logical truth or the logical validity of an argument. We have not asked such questions as 'lq What does a logical truth say? and 'lq What does a logically valid argument guarantee with true premises? Let us assume that even the premises are accepted by atheists. Do they all convert to theism? If that were so, the disagreement between atheist and believer over the ontological arguments should turn only on the truth of premises. If that is not so, there is some point in raising this other question. If there are people who, recognizing the premises and validity of an argument, are still reluctant to accept the conclusion, we have reason to question the function of a valid argument. I argue that there is a way of being consistently reasonable while accepting the premises and the validity of the ontological arguments and yet remaining an atheist or an agnostic.

 The being and value of health	 Werkhoven, Sander	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	2014	 The principle aim of this thesis is to provide an account of the nature of health. The starting-point is that health is a normative concept: health implies a standard or norm in relation to which an organism’s state is evaluated. Many philosophers take this to imply that health must be defined in subjective terms. They either think health consists in a certain type of subjective experience (e.g. Canguilhem, Fulford), or that health is relative to subjective values and goals (e.g. Nietzsche, Korsgaard, Nordenfelt). I argue that subjective definitions of health fail to capture the essential properties of health and attempt to show that health is something normative and yet entirely objective. This would imply that there are normative facts in the world, and to support this claim I turn to debates in contemporary meta-ethics. I develop a meta-ethical theory according to which a subset of non-moral goods is grounded in objective features of living beings, and argue that this meta-ethical theory opens the possibility for an objective account of health. I then proceed to develop a theory of health that aims to capture what it means for any living to be healthy. I argue that the concept of health latches onto organisms’ capacities (or dispositions): the greater an organism’s range of capacities (or quantity of dispositions), i.e. the more it is capable of doing, the healthier it is. The norm relative to which an organism’s range of capacities is measured in evaluations of health, I go on to argue, is the maximum range of capacities possible for the species. Accordingly, an organism is healthy if it is capable of performing all species-specific activities. A closer analysis of this claim yields the formal definition that health consists in a multiplicity of potential activity vis-à-vis factual limitations set by the species. This definition of health is defended against various objections and potential counterexamples. In the context of human health, I attempt to show this definition of health captures both physical and mental dimensions of health; that it establishes a direct link between health and individual autonomy; and that it supports a Nietzschean account of ‘the greathealth’—the idea that being able to give up the concern for one’s health constitutes a superior kind of health. In the conclusions, I reflect on whether this conception of health could function as an ethical ideal, and consider the form that a health-based ethics could take.

 The Son and the Sons of God : a study in the elements of Paul's christological and soteriological thought	 Wanamaker, C. A.	 Durham University	 Durham University	1980	This thesis examines Paul's use of the divine Sonship conception in order to discover its place and significance in his Christological and soteriological thought. Because Paul relates the divine Sonship idea both to Christ and to Christians, this thesis naturally divides into two main parts: Part one studies the divine Sonship of Christ, and part two investigates the divine sonship of Christians. Our examination in part one reveals that Sonship characterizes Christ's relation with God at every stage of his existence from before he became a man through to his present position as universal sovereign. The divine Sonship which Paul attributes to Christ is of fundamental importance for understanding the unique roles which Christ plays in creation and redemption. In particular, Paul's soteriology is inconceivable without the supposition of the divine Sonship of Christ. Paul's own belief in the divine Sonship of the man Jesus of Nazareth arose through the revelation he received at his conversion and call. Because of this experience, the Son of God became the content of Paul's Gospel. In part two we show that Paul's believer sonship conception was in continuity with his Jewish heritage and the teaching tradition associated with Jesus. By a careful examination of Gal. 3-4 and Rom. 8-9 we demonstrate that Paul attributed great significance to the idea of the divine sonship of Christians. This concept expresses the continuity between the present and future experience of salvation, while emphasizing its personal character. We also discover that believer sonship was capable of embracing a variety of other important aspects in Pauline theology. When the two sides of divine Sonship are seen together, especially in their relationship to one another, the one theme of divine Sonship is seen to provide a very valuable perspective on Paul's Christological and soteriological thought.

Linguistic representation : a study on Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein, 1912-1922	 Iglesias, Teresa	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	1979	The study is concerned with some aspects of the philosophical development of Russell and Wittgenstein in the period in which their doctrines interacted closely with each other. The questions investigated -nay be summarised as follows: (i) What does it mean to say that language represents reality in an isomorphic manner ? (ii) How is it possible for language to represent reality isomorphically and yet be related to it in such a way that the relation it has in virtue of its sense is independent of the relation it has in virtue of its truth? In answering these questions, particular attention has been paid to Russell's unpublished Manuscript Epistemology (1913) because of the impact it had on Wittgenstein, who severely criticised it. These criticisms began to emerge, as an alternative to Russell's views, in 'Notes on Logic' and in the other pre-Tractarian writings. It is in the Tractatus, eventually, that the two-fold relation between language and reality, which Russell's position left unexplained, is accounted for, by virtue of the distinction form/structure. The following are the central theses of this study: (a) Although Russell and Wittgenstein share the assumption of linguistic isomorphic representation, their isomorphisms are totally different, since Wittgenstein makes the distinction form/structure and Russell does not; (b) Wittgenstein's development from the earlier writings to the Tractatus may be viewed in terms of the emergence of distinctions such as, the world as substance/the world as fact, possibilities/ actualities, form/structure, which lie at the heart of the Tractatus and serve to substantiate its central semantic doctrine concerning the language-reality relation of representation; (c) since the Tractatus maintains the principle that 'sense is independent of the facts' (i.e., that there is an independence or priority of sense over truth) then a proposition's relation to reality cannot be accounted for by means of ostension, for such an account involves the denial of the principle; (d) the divergence between Russell and Wittgenstein as regards the main concern of the Tractatus, centres on the divergence of their views concerning the vagueness of ordinary language; (e) a central aspect of the unity of Wittgenstein's entire philosophy, as regards the internal relation- ship between language and reality, lies in his conception of form.

 Global health care injustice : an analysis of the demands of the basic right to health care	 West-Oram, Peter George Negus	 University of Birmingham	 University of Birmingham	2015	 Henry Shue’s model of basic rights and their correlative duties provides an excellent framework for analysing the requirements of global distributive justice, and for theorising about the minimum acceptable standards of human entitlement and wellbeing. Shue bases his model on the claim that certain ‘basic’ rights are of universal instrumental value, and are necessary for the enjoyment of any other rights, and of any ‘decent life’. Shue’s model provides a comprehensive argument about the importance of certain fundamental goods for all human lives, though he does not consider health or health care in any significant detail. Adopting Shue’s model, I argue that access to health care is of sufficient importance to the enjoyment of any other rights that it qualifies as what Shue describes as a ‘basic’ right. I also argue that the basic right to health care is compatible with the basic rights model, and is required by it in order to for it to achieve its goal of enabling right holders to enjoy any decent life. In making this claim I also explore the requirements of the basic right to health care in terms of Shue’s triumvirate of duties and with reference to several key examples.

 The meaning of truth : Tarski, deflationism, and interpretation	 Collins, John Patrick	 Birkbeck (University of London)	 Birkbeck (University of London)	1998	 The aim of my thesis is to develop a third way to truth, between traditional substantive theories, and deflationist accounts which seek to show that truth has no content. I begin with Tarski's definition of truth, and show that the definition enables the elimination of 'is true' in terms of the concepts expressible in the object-language (+logic/set theory). The definition, therefore, appears to provide a basis for deflationism. I consider a variety of deflationisms. Their common denominator is the thought that the content of truth is exhausted by the content of the sentences to which truth is applied: truth has no independent content; it has a mere grammatical convenience. While I admit the deflationist hue of Tarski's definition, I show that the definition contains resources to account for ". substantive features of our semantic competence. Extrapolating from these resources, I claim that a suitably constrained truth theory is an interpretive theory (ITT). The significance of the notion of an ITT is that it provides an interpretive conception of truth. I show that such a conception is neither reductionist nor deflationary. Further, I argue that an adequate ITT, although extensional, does capture the distinctions taken to be constitutive of our concept of meaning. From the perspective of an ITT, I argue that none of the deflationist theories can account for central features of truth: principally, the semantic paradoxes and heterophonic ascriptions. I conclude that deflationism is, at best, an etiolated account of truth.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	298277	1
 The concept of order in science and theology with special reference to the thought of Michael Polanyi	 Thomson, Alexander	 University of Aberdeen	 University of Aberdeen	1985	 The thesis begins with a critical comparison of the philosophy of Michael Polanyi, John Macmurray, Karl Popper and Albert Einstein. This serves to highlight several important features of Michael Polanyi's philosophy which are of relevance. From this preliminary discussion of Michael Polanyi's philosophy it becomes clear that certain ultimate beliefs underly all scientific work - a belief in order, a belief in its contingent singular nature, and a belief that we can know that order. The ultimate beliefs found in the scientific community are paralleled by a similar set of beliefs in the Christian community, and this community is itself ordered by principles which this thesis would maintain are equivalent to those found in t The prayers and worship of the Christian community, by which we come to know the divine order, are then compared and contrasted with scientific research, by which we come to know nature's order. This leads on to a discussion of miracles.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	333083	1
 Courage and the soul in Plato	 Mawby, Helen Margaret Clare	 University of Glasgow	 University of Glasgow	2006	In the Introduction I briefly lay out the history of the value terms that I will be considering in my thesis and consider the philosophical relevance of the development of such values in the 5th century. The infiltration of modern ideas of morality into what was considered to be good to the Greeks has a great influence on the literature and philosophy of this period. Plato prioritises these quiet moral virtues, but also tries to hang on to some of what had come before, and thus faces difficulties with his moral theory. I will show that courage presents Plato with an acute difficulty when attempting to develop a consistent ethical theory. In Chapter 2 I look at the Protagoras where the main issues about courage that Plato will continue to discuss throughout his life are introduced. The questions of the extent to which the virtues can be taught and the unity of the virtues are introduced early on. What follows is an attempt to explain and justify the Socratic idea that the virtues are co-dependent and that they all in some way boil down to knowledge. In Chapter 3 on the Laches I will show that the discussion focuses more particularly on the virtue of courage and is mostly a more sophisticated attempt to understand courage than the one presented in the Protagoras. In the following three chapters (4-6) I examine the position taken in the Republic in detail, which I take to be more representative of the Platonic rather than Socratic position. Plato’s psychological model – which includes direct influence from the lower soul – is a more reasonable interpretation of the internal workings of the agent than the simpler model in the early dialogues of the only direct motivator being beliefs or knowledge. The chapter on the Laws considers the idea that some of the apparent differences between the Republic and the Laws are due to Plato’s growing realisation that courage will not be assimilated into a unified ethical theory of the type that he wishes to propose.

 Kierkegaard's contribution to the philosophy of history	 Patios, Georgios	 University of Liverpool	 University of Liverpool	2012	 Kierkegaard is well known as a witty writer mainly occupied with Christianity. In this thesis however, Kierkegaard is depicted as a philosopher who can provide us with some new and authentic ideas about the nature of history. Kierkegaard’s approach to the problem of history is compared with Hegel’s philosophy of history and Heidegger’s view of history. Hegel’s philosophy of history is examined and analysed first and the conclusion is that we can clearly detect two main Hegelian assertions regarding history: first that reason is the main historical agent and second that human beings can fully know their past history. Kierkegaard’s arguments follow a totally different approach from that of Hegel’s. Kierkegaard argues that we cannot fully know our past history and that the crucial element in history is to decide about our future history instead of simply trying to understand our past history. It is also argued that Kierkegaard constructs human self in such a way that human beings must simultaneously create themselves and history by making decisions regarding their present and their future. It is further argued that neither Hegel nor Kierkegaard can, on their own, provide us with a total and full picture of the nature of history because Hegel on the one hand, focuses on the macroscopic view of history and Kierkegaard on the other, on the microscopic view (that is, from the point of view of the individual). This is why a possible synthesis of both views is suggested as a better way to truly understand history. Heidegger’s view of history is examined as a possible ‘existential’ alternative approach to history from that of Kierkegaard’s. The conclusion is that Heidegger cannot really offer us any help because he is either borrowing his main concepts from Kierkegaard or he is too vague.

 A philosophy of war	 Moseley, Darran A.	 University of Edinburgh	 University of Edinburgh	1997	 This thesis examines in four parts a collection of philosophical arguments dealing with war. The conclusions drawn are that war is a definable and applicable concept, that above the level of biological reactions war is the result of beliefs, that an objective distinction exists between aggressive and defensive actions, and that war is only justifiable in the protection of core rights. The first part analyses competing definitions of war. It is argued that the concept of war is philosophically appropriate and captures the conceptual common denominator between particular wars. The essence of war is defined as “a condition of open-ended violence”. Part Two explores the causal relationships between metaphysical and epistemological beliefs and war. It is held that war cannot be explained away as an unalterable fact of the universe, hence deterministic explanations fail in favour of the conclusion that wars are the product of ideas and ideas are volitionally obtained. The third part continues an exploration of determinist accounts of war and examines how various theories of human nature attempt to explain why war occurs. For methodological purposes human nature is trisected into biological, cultural, and rational aspects. Theories that attempt to interpret war using only a single aspect are inadequate, for each aspect must logically presuppose the existence and hence the influence of the others. It is concluded that human wars are the product of ideas, but ideas are distinguishable between tacit and explicit forms. Tacit forms of knowledge evolve through social interaction and sometimes have unintended consequences; war on the cultural level can be the product of human action but not of human design (Ferguson), hence attempts to abolish war by reason alone are bound to fail. Part Four assesses the application of ethical and political reasoning to war. It is argued firstly that morality, in the form of universalisable core rights and socially generated general rules of conduct, must not be removed from the sphere of war. Secondly it is concluded that the ideal just government exists to protect rights, from which it will follow that defensive wars and wars of intervention to protect rights are morally supportable.

 Justice, constructivism, and the egalitarian ethos : explorations in Rawlsian political philosophy	 Kurtulmus, A. Faik	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2010	 This thesis defends John Rawls’s constructivist theory of justice against three distinct challenges. Part one addresses G.A. Cohen’s claim that Rawls’s constructivism is committed to a mistaken thesis about the relationship between facts and principles. It argues that Rawls’s constructivist procedure embodies substantial moral commitments, and offers an intra-normative reduction rather than a metaethical account. Rawls’s claims about the role of facts in moral theorizing in A Theory of Justice should be interpreted as suggesting that some of our moral beliefs, which we are inclined to hold without reference to facts, are, in fact, true, because certain facts obtain. This thesis and the acknowledgement of the moral assumptions of Rawls’s constructivism help to show that Rawls does not, and does not need to, deny Cohen’s thesis. Part two defends the characterization of the decision problem in Rawls’s original position as a decision problem under uncertainty. Rawls stipulates that the denizens of the original position lack information that they could use to arrive at estimates of the likelihood of ending up in any given social position. It has been argued that Rawls does not have good grounds for this stipulation. I argue that given the nature of the value function we should attribute to the denizens of the original position and our cognitive limitations, which also apply to the denizens of the original position, their decision problem can be characterized as one under uncertainty even if we stipulate that they know that they have an equal chance of being in any individual’s place. Part three assesses the claim that a true commitment to Rawls’s difference principle requires a further commitment to an egalitarian ethos. This egalitarian ethos is offered as a means to bring about equality and Pareto-optimality. Accordingly, I try to undermine the case for an egalitarian ethos by challenging the desirability of the ends it is supposed to further or by showing that it is redundant. I argue that if primary goods are the metric of justice, then Pareto optimality in the space of the metric of justice is undesirable. I then argue that if the metric of justice is welfare, depending on the theory of welfare we adopt, an egalitarian ethos will either be redundant or will have objectionably paternalistic consequences.

 Beyond stewardship : the search for a truly ecological Christian spirituality	 Ridd, Kevin Norman	 University of Bristol	 University of Bristol	2003	 The object of this research is to discover how Christianity can be reformed so that it could provide the foundation of a truly ecological spirituality. It is the contention of the thesis that the planet currently faces an ecological crisis that has largely been brought about by human activity, encouraged by a particular worldview, which sees the non-human creation as of no value in itself and merely an object to be used. The work argues that those who see traditional Christian theology as a contributory factor in this destructive world-view are correct. The first chapter of the thesis seeks to describe the crisis and define the terms "ecology" and "Christian spirituality". Chapter Two examines the mainstream Christian response to the ecological crisis thus far, namely the "stewardship approach", and argues that this approach has serious weaknesses. Chapter Three strives to move beyond stewardship and looks specifically at how the person of Jesus of Nazareth can become a focus for ecological thinking. Chapter Four continues this theme by exploring images of the Christ, with the aim of showing how these images can encourage an ecological awareness and practice. Chapter Five looks at other faiths and forms of thought which give insights that could be resources in the journey towards an ecological Christian spirituality. Finally, Chapter Six sets out to formulate such a spirituality, looking at its theology, liturgy, and practice as well as at the spirituality itself. Overall, the thesis is a contribution to the growing field of Ecotheology. It seeks to show how Christianity can move from being a part of the ecological problem to encouraging a transformative praxis that could offer hope of a solution to the crisis by effecting a fundamental change of heart in its adherents through the spirituality it engenders.

Pictorial signification through praxis : an investigation into the visual fiction of American photorealism  (1967-1977)	 Riley, Kirsten Helene Frances	 University of Glasgow	 University of Glasgow	2011	Photorealism was a movement which focused on meticulously reproducing the quotidian photograph on a large scale. Despite its popularity from between 1967-1977, it was often considered by critics to be vacuous and anachronistic. This was due to several factors, most significant of which were its focus on the outmoded practice of pictorial realism, the banality of its subjects and its apparent plagiaristic approach to the photograph-as-source. This neutral and cool aesthetic was misunderstood as superficial and served to render the movement the very antithesis of aesthetic creativity. This thesis seeks to reconsider such apparent objectivity in Photorealist painting by presenting a semiotic reading of Photorealist practice that will form the basis of the central argument in this thesis. This argument posits that there are evidential layers of signification embedded within the making of a Photorealist work which enact perceptual, conventional and historical conditions that deny the project of visual neutrality. This argument will prove that Photorealism was not a clear continuation of traditional pictorial realism, but a more conceptual movement which questioned conceptions of the phenomenological real. It will also show how, in Photorealism’s transmutation of the photographic aesthetic, it instigated the development of a hybrid visual language – a ‘route to meaning’ – which served to occupy the vacant space between the painting and the photograph. To reveal the development of such a language, and its inherently subjectivist foundations, I will inquire into the Photorealist painting from its very beginnings – from perceptual conception to conclusion – within the realm of the artist. The methodology for such an inquiry will involve the development and application of a heuristic model, informed by a semiotic approach, which will show how reality in Photorealism is mediated and transformed in the process of (re)-presenting the photograph. This model will categorise the key stages of activity and influence in the Photorealist process, showing at each stage how visual language is engendered and compounded. By adopting such an approach this thesis will show that Photorealist paintings, contrary to much criticism, managed to establish a unique and significant manner of depicting the real that is now worthy of contemporary reappraisal.

 Against purity : identity, western feminisms and Indian complications	 Gedalof, Irene	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	1997	 This thesis argues that Western feminist theoretical models of identity can be productively complicated by the insights of postcolonial feminisms. In particular, it explores ways that Western feminist theory might more adequately sustain a focus on 'women' while keeping open a space for differences such as race and nation. Part One identifies a number of themes that emerge from recent Indian feminist scholarship on the intersections of sex, gender, race, nation and community identities. Part Two uses these insights to look critically at the work of four Western theorists, Rosi Braidotti, Judith Butler, Donna Haraway and Luce Irigaray. I argue that strategies which privilege sexual difference as primary cannot deal adequately with differences such as race and nation. But I also argue that strategies which privilege destabilizing identity can be equally constrained by the logic of dualisms which has made it so difficult for feminists to sustain a focus on women and their differences. Part Three discusses how the insights to be drawn from Indian ferninisms might be taken on board by Western ferninisms in order to develop more complex models of power, identity and the self. Throughout the thesis I draw on a Foucauldian understanding of power as productive, and on Foucault's insight that subjects and identities emerge, not through the imperatives of a single symbolic system, but through the intersection of multiple networks of discourses, material practices and institutions. I argue that, by attending to women's complex location within intersecting landscapes of gender, nation, race and other community identities, feminist models of identity can dispense with a logic of dualisms in order to redefine, and not only destabilize 'women' as the subject of/for feminism. This requires working against purity on three levels. First, it requires a model of power that gives up on the search for pure, power-free zones and works instead with the instabilities power produces as it both enables and constrains women. Second, it requires seeing 'women' as a complex, impure category that bleeds across the apparently coherent borders of identity categories such as gender, race and nation, and contesting discursive constructs of 'Woman' as the pure space of origin upon which these apparently discrete categories stand. Third, it requires the development of alternative models of the self that take these complex, impure spaces as a valid and valorised position from which to act and to speak.

 Morality and political modernity : the relationship between the political philosophy of Leo Strauss and the cultural politics of neoconservatism	 Hancock, David	 Kingston University	 Kingston University	2013	This thesis explores the relationship between the political philosophy of Leo Strauss and neoconservative cultural politics. Arguing against claims that Straussian philosophy explicitly informs neoconservatism, I instead suggest that both Strauss and the neoconservatives share a common intellectual lineage that is a response to a pessimistic conception of modernity. Strauss is a neoconservative, but neoconservatives should not necessarily be considered Straussians. Both Strauss and the neoconservatives became notorious in the aftermath of the US led invasion of Iraq in March, 2003. Contra to the narrative that suggests that Strauss inspired the invasion or that neoconservative foreign policy presents a radical break in US history, I argue that the neoconservative project of the Bush era should be understood as a continuation of US expansionism as an inevitable effect of capitalist growth. Beyond foreign policy, my research considers the neoconservative understanding of cultural politics in particular relation to the social changes of the post war era. This thesis details the neoconservative attempt to move beyond the contradiction surrounding a distrust of modernity and the embrace of virulently nihilist capitalism. This is read through the Straussian idea that it is essential to practice care when speaking publicly. This thesis concludes that neoconservatism is an explicitly moral discourse and not a particular set of policies or strategies. Neoconservatism recognises the necessity of moral discourse and the importance of the construction of such discourses for the establishment of the community. It is argued that the neoconservative attempt to re-impose discredited moral orders has led to the exacerbation of America's contradictions and to decline in American power. Beyond this, it is also argued that Strauss does make a contribution to political philosophy in terms of the relationship between city and man; this contribution to political philosophy is used to interpret elements of post-war American history.

 The metaphysics of privileged properties	 Wilson, Aaron	 University of Manchester	 University of Manchester	2016	Objects are characterised by their properties. If an object is a red postbox, then it has the property of being red, and the property of being a postbox. This thesis is an attack on a particular view of the metaphysics of properties, according to which some properties are privileged over others. The most well-known theories of privileged properties are Armstrong’s theory of sparse immanent universals (1979b) and Lewis’ natural properties (1983). According to their supporters, only privileged properties perform certain jobs, such as featuring in laws of nature, or grounding similarity between objects. Metaphysical posits are theoretically virtuous if they can account for a range of different phenomena in a relatively parsimonious manner. The ability of privileged properties to perform a range of worthwhile ‘work’, therefore, is what justifies a belief in them. The conclusion I reach is that a single group of properties is not capable of satisfying the key roles commonly attributed to the privileged properties. Without satisfying these roles in concert, a belief in mainstream versions of privileged properties is not justified. The first part of this thesis is devoted to an explication of privilege and the roles which privileged properties are taken to perform. I conclude that three roles in particular, Supervenience, Similarity and Magnetism are key roles for mainstream theories of privilege. In part two, I show that the properties which satisfy the Supervenience role are not the same as those which satisfy the Similarity and Magnetism roles. In the final chapter of this thesis I discuss the implications of my findings for support for theories of privilege.

 Two sources of moral reasons	 Macdonald, Iain Ezra	 University of St Andrews	 University of St Andrews	2010	 One of the core questions in contemporary metaethics concerns the nature and status of moral claims. However, this question presupposes that morality is unified, and that a single metaethical account will suffice. This thesis aims to challenge that presupposition. In particular, I argue that there is a substantial theoretical payoff to be had from combining two distinct metaethical theories – realism, on the one hand, and constructivism, on the other – whilst limiting the scope of each. In the realist case, the discourse aims to describe a particular feature of reality; in the constructivist case, the discourse aims to solve some of the coordination problems faced by people as social beings. We have, therefore, two distinct sources of moral reasons. The resulting ‘hybrid’ theory is appealing at the metaethical level, but also yields an attractive picture at the applied level. Specifically, it retains the core intuition underlying utilitarianism, whilst incorporating a broadly contractarian account of morality. On this account, our reasons for not harming other persons are at least the same as our reasons for not harming animals – but we have additional reasons to refrain from harming persons. Chapter One establishes a moderate presumption in favour of moral realism, understood as the claim that moral discourse aims to represent the world, deals in objective truths, and yields statements capable of truth or falsity. Chapter Two addresses arguments for moral antirealism: these arguments can be met by restricting the scope of moral realism. Chapter Three explores the content of the resultant moral realism: specifically, realism about the intrinsic value of hedonic states. Chapter Four deals with that part of morality which is unaccounted for by restricted moral realism, and offers an outline form of contractarian constructivism. Chapter Five investigates the consequences of the hybrid metaethical theory for applied ethics.	 Thesis or dissertation	BJ1031.M3 ; Ethics ; Moral realism ; Constructivism (Philosophy)	552451	1
 Responsibilities for the global health crisis	 de Campos, Thana Cristina	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2014	 This thesis aims to provide a framework for analyzing the moral responsibilities of global agents in what I call the Global Health Crisis (GHC), with special attention devoted to the moral responsibilities of pharmaceutical companies. The main contribution of this thesis is to provide a general account of the moral responsibilities of different global players, mapping the different kinds of duties they have, their content and force, and their relation to the responsibilities of other relevant actors in the GHC. I also apply this account to current debates surrounding the need for reforms to the international legal rules addressing the GHC, notably the TRIPs regime. In doing so, this thesis will discuss the allocation of responsibilities for the GHC among different global players, such as state and non-state actors, the latter including pharmaceutical companies. In order to investigate the allocation of duties, I will first analyze the object of such allocation which constitutes the object of the current GHC (Part A); then the agents responsible for addressing this crisis (Part B); and finally, existing institutional alternatives to reform the international legal rules addressing the GHC, such as the TRIPs regime (Part C).

 The philosophy of language in Gadādhara's Śaktivāda	 Ganeri, Jonardon	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	1993	This thesis is a study of the theory of meaning developed by the seventeenth century Indian Naiyāyika philosopher Gadādhara Bhaṭṭācārya. It has four chapters and an appendix. In chapter 1, I highlight some of the problems about meaning and reference thematised by the Indian philosophical tradition during its 'classical' period (third century B.C.E. to seventh century C.E). The work of the earliest grammarians proved very influential We tend to associate the name of the grammarian Vyddi with the origins of the study of singular reference in classical India, and I look at his theory, the problems it faced, and the innovations of early Nyāya, Mimāṃsā and grammarian authors. In the second chapter, I discuss Gadādhara's analysis of the semantics of nominal stems, his construction of a 'two-component' theory of meaning, and his criticisms of the work of earlier Navya-Naiyāyikas, especially Vardhamāna and Raghunātha. The main theme of this debate concerns the failure of a realist or referential theory of meaning to serve as a complete theory of meaning, one which recognises both the intensional and the context-invariant elements in the meaning of nominal expressions. The third chapter deals with Gadādhara's theory of anaphoric pronouns. I argue in particular that Gadādhara's use of a two-component meaning theory enables him to construct a theory ofpronouns which significantly improves on the proposals of earlier Navya-Nyāya authors. In the fourth chapter, I discuss the epistemological dimension to the Nyāya conception of language; the Nyāya doctrine that linguistic competence consists in the knowledge of a compositional meaning theory; the role of convention in the Nyāya theory, and their thesis that conventions are grounded in the authority of the name-giver. I have added an appendix in which I examine the technical language by means of which Gadādhara is able to give his arguments great precision. I show that this language can be translated into a certain fragment of quantified first-order predicate logic.

 The nature of commonsense psychological explanation	 Crawford, Michael Sean	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	1999	This thesis is concerned with two kinds of 'singular' psychological phenomena. The first is the commonsense psychological explanation of action directed upon particular things and stuffs. The second is the nature of (visual) perceptual demonstrative thought. The two topics are brought together in an account of psychological explanation I call 'de re psychological explanation'. The primary aim of the thesis is to articulate and defend this account. The main thesis I seek to establish is that an adequate psychological explanation of an agent's action upon an object requires a relational or de re ascription of thought that (1) relates the agent to the object and (2) makes reference to a perceptual demonstrative mode of presentation of the object. This thesis is defended in two stages. In the first chapter I argue for the first half of the thesis, that relational ascriptions are necessary in any explanation of an action involving an object. In the fourth chapter I argue for the second half, that it is necessary that these relational ascriptions make reference to a perceptual demonstrative mode of presentation of the object acted on. The second half of the thesis involves the notion of a perceptual demonstrative mode of presentation. This necessitates an account of the nature of perceptual demonstrative thoughts, which is undertaken in chapters two and three. In the second chapter I explore two prominent theories of perceptual demonstrative thought. In the third chapter I sketch a new account 'property-dependent externalism' and argue that it is more adequate than the others. In chapter four, I return to de re explanation and develop it further into a covering-law account of psychological explanation. The rest of the thesis is given over to defending the elaborated covering-law account against two objections. I draw the claws of the first objection in the second half of the fourth chapter and answer the second objection in the final chapter.

 'Things seen and unseen' : the logic of incarnation in Merleau-Ponty's ontology of flesh	 Edgar, Orion	 University of Nottingham	 University of Nottingham	2012	 My thesis here is that Merleau-Ponty’s ontology of flesh, in its development, suggests a logic of incarnation which carries philosophical ontology beyond entrenched dualisms, and offers to Christian theology a route away from dualistic compromises and back to its own deepest insight. I set out first to develop Merleau-Ponty’s fleshly ontology by tracing its roots in his early thought on the reversibility of perception, which installs the perceiver at the heart of a world with which he is engaged and on which he depends; this relationship is grounded in the elemental faith of perception. I develop this perceptual understanding with reference to eating as a mode of perception; hunger joins our biological needs to their imaginative development, and Man, the hungry animal, transforms his desire, and thus his world. I show how dualistic ontologies are grounded in a geometrical conception of nature which founds a notion of God as removed from the world in the absolute distance of the geometer from geometry, and argue that this mathematisation of nature is hypostasised in the modern understanding of vision. I develop a counter-understanding which liberates the seer from his incarceration in immobility, emphasising that sight depends on movement and on its imbrication with the other senses, involving us in a world of existential significance, and suggesting a partial recovery of the extramission and species theories of sight. I then argue that nature must be understood in terms of place, rather than as a spatiotemporal container. There is a fundamental man-nature chiasm which precedes analysis. Incarnation is not an insertion into nature but a flowering within it of a fundamental logos. This grounds metaphysics in the perceived world, affirming meaning within contingency. For a Christian theology rooted in such a notion of incarnation, God is revealed in the depths of nature and history.	 Thesis or dissertation	 BD Speculative philosophy	576814	1

 Adorno, Foucault, and the history of the present	 Mascaretti, Giovanni M.	 University of Essex	 University of Essex	2017	What is the nature of our society? What kinds of power regimes shape our existence? What forms of emancipatory resistance might chart the way towards a better future that responds to the dangers, injustices, and pathologies marking the present? These are just some of the questions my dissertation aims to answer through the help of the conceptual resources that Theodor Adorno and Michel Foucault provide us with. Accordingly, whereas the few attempts that have been made been to compare their works remain inadequate, partial, or simply out-dated, my thesis offers a detailed and comprehensive appraisal of both the explanatory and reconstructive potential of Adorno’s and Foucault’s common project of developing a critico-theoretical account of modern Western society, with a view also to showing the often-neglected compatibility of their respective approaches. At issue, is not only the scholarly reconstruction of a possible dialogue beyond their differences, but also, and more importantly, the analysis of the continued relevance of their works for our understanding of the world we inhabit. To this end, Chapters 1 and 2 start with an examination of the historical conditions Adorno and Foucault see at the root of the dangers and pathologies ailing our age. More specifically, Chapter 1 starts with a review of Adorno’s conception of late modern society as a reified totality ruled by the logic of capitalist exchange. I then confront Adorno’s account of social domination with Foucault’s early analytics of power and illustrate the similarities between their pictures of the disciplinary mechanisms at the basis of the constitution of modern individuals. The chapter concludes by presenting their critique of the scientific discourses and ideological procedures that have supported these power mechanisms. After examining the connection they establish between the development of capitalism and modern biopower, Chapter 2 compares Foucault’s and Adorno’s portraits of the political culture of liberalism. Whereas the relevance of Adorno’s insights is manly confined to the processes of socialization characterizing the welfare states in the first half of the 20th century, I argue that Foucault’s later inquiries shed an instructive light on the reconfiguration determined by the rise of neoliberalism in the contemporary technologies of government, whereby the latter are no longer based on the rigid mechanisms of disciplinary power, but rather on the fabrication of the subject as a free and responsible entrepreneur through more indirect and flexible forms of control operating on the social environment. Chapters 3 to 5 explore the anticipatory-utopian dimension of Adorno’s and Foucault’s enterprises. Chapter 3 engages in a largely unprecedented comparison of their critical approaches. Despite their different targets and narratives, I contend that they converge in the project of a critical problematization of the present, which seeks to modify their addressees’ sensibility and experience not only to show the historical contingency of the present, but also to encourage its radical transformation. Contrary to the popular view that they lack normative theorizing, Chapter 4 reviews Adorno’s and Foucault’s accounts of the normativity of critique, while pointing to their common attempt at giving new impetus to the emancipatory thrust of Enlightenment modernity. Chapter 5 elaborates a much overdue evaluation of their responses to the ethico-political challenges of the present through a juxtaposition of Adorno’s minimal ethics of resistance with Foucault’s late ethical reflections on the ancient practices of care of the self, which lie at the source of his more ambitious politics of the governed. The chapter closes by proposing a possible way of integrating Foucault’s call for creative resistance with Adorno’s politics of suffering. In conclusion, my dissertation assesses Adorno’s and Foucault’s merits in the construction of a critical “ontology of the present” that stands opposed to the neo-Idealist turn of much of contemporary critical theory with its separation of normative and empirical claims from the material forms of power shaping individuals’ subjectivity, cultural patterns, and institutional structures, while eventually arguing that Foucault gives us a more effective toolbox not only to comprehend who we are, but also to imagine ourselves otherwise.

 Ambiguous artefacts : towards a cognitive anthropology of art	 Jucker, Jean-Luc	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2012	This thesis proposes elements for a cognitive anthropology of visual art. Most works of art are human-made objects that cannot be approached in purely functional terms, and as such they frustrate important cognitive expectations that people have about artefacts. For this reason, it is hypothesised that art triggers speculation about the artist’s intention, and that it is intuitively approached as a form of communication. By application of Bloom’s (1996) theory of artefact categorisation, and Sperber and Wilson’s (1986/1995) relevance theory of communication, a series of predictions are generated for art categorisation (or definition), art appreciation, and art cultural distribution. Two empirical studies involving more than 1,000 participants tested the most important of these predictions. In study 1, a relationship was found between how much a series of works of art were liked and how easy they were to understand. Study 2 comprised four experiments. In experiment 1, a series of hyperrealistic paintings were preferred when they were labelled as paintings than when they were labelled as photographs. In experiments 2a and 2b, a series of paintings were considered easier to understand and, under some conditions, were preferred, when they were accompanied by titles that made it easier to understand the artist’s intention. In experiment 3, a series of artefacts were more likely to be considered “art” when they were thought to have been created intentionally than when they were thought to have been created accidentally. The results of studies 1 and 2 confirmed the predictions tested, and are interpreted in the framework of relevance theory. The art experience involves speculation about the artist’s intention, and it is partly assessed as a form of communication that is constrained by relevance dynamics. Implications for anthropology of art, psychology of art, and the art world are discussed.

 Marx, Weber and the methodology of social science	 Fryer, Philip D.	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	1980	This thesis is primarily concerned with the relationship between realism in philosophy and in social science. I attempt to expound and defend two principal arguments; first, that a realist approach in philosophy is a precondition of understanding science as a rational activity; secondly, that only a realist approach to the understanding of social phenomena seems to offer hope for developing an account of social inquiry based on scientific principles. However, these two arguments are developed by way of a critical analysis of the realist view in relationship to some of its major rivals. Consequently, as well as my realist exposition of Marx's methodology of science outlined in chapters five and six, where I argue that only a dialectico-causal interpretation of historical materialism seems to meet the requirements of an historical science, there is a chapter on Weber's methodology (hence the title of the thesis) and a section on other approaches to social science stating my case against the attempt to found social inquiry on alternative cognitive foundations. In addition, the argument against non-realist views of social science is extended to the critique of Marxism itself especially in the context of the theories of Colletti and Althusser contained in chapter 4.

 Pragmatism and pluralism : how to avoid becoming a physicalist	 Ritchie, John Miller	 London School of Economics and Political Science (University of London)	 London School of Economics and Political Science	2002	 This thesis can be split into two sections. The first section is an argument against physicalism and its naturalistic pretensions. The second section presents an alternative to physicalism - pragmatic pluralism. The arguments for the first section are split into four chapters. In chapter one it is argued that an examination of science lends no support to physicalist ontology. The case of quantum chemistry is studied in some detail and its shown that higher-level chemical facts are needed to support the quantum mechanical explanations given. The second and third chapters look at various ways in which physicalist have sought to explain away the apparent lack of unity in the sciences. Various accounts of the supervenience relation and functionalism are discussed and shown to be either inadequate for the physicalist programme or empirically implausible. The final chapter of this section discusses the so called completeness of physics. It is shown that like physicalism in general, there is no way to formulate this doctrine to make it plausible in light of contemporary physics and able to underpin a physicalist ontology. The second section critically discusses alternatives to physicalism. The scientific pluralisms of John Dupre and Nancy Cartwright and the pragmatic pluralisms of Hilary Putnam and Nelson Goodman are discussed in detail. Drawing on the work of Putnam, in particular, and presenting Davidson's anomalous monism in a new guise, an original form of pragmatic or metaphysically deflationary pluralism is defended.

 The presence of Nietzsche in Heidegger's The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics : a philosophical Auseinandersetzung	 Laleh, Justin	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	2013	It is my contention that the presence of Nietzsche in FCM is of central importance for both reading this text, and for understanding the stakes of Heidegger's Auseinandersetzung with Nietzsche. This thesis will, therefore, endeavour to re-locate FCM within the Heideggerian corpus via a reading of the text “as a whole”. The focus of this re-location, and indeed the locus of this reading as a whole, is the contention that FCM is part of a Heideggerian Auseinandersetzung with Nietzsche. This task is a response to the majority of existing readings of the 1929/30 lecture course that regard it as a fragmented work, and subsequently focus on its two most novel elements in isolation (namely Heidegger's analysis of boredom and the supposed “theoretical biology” that comprises the majority of 'Part Two'). When read out of context, and as a fractured project, FCM appears to straightforwardly reassert the primacy of man in western metaphysics, thus succumbing to the pitfalls of a “metaphysics of subjectivity”. On the basis of a reading of Nietzsche's presence in FCM, I will situate 'Part Two' within a philosophical and hermeneutical context not established in other readings heretofore. This opens the space for the genuine philosophical trajectory of the text to emerge, namely the grounding of a confrontation (an Auseinandersetzung) with Nietzsche as the site of contemporary philosophising. Taking up this trajectory allows for a re-invigorated understanding of the development of Heidegger's Nietzsche reading, and a deepening of the case regarding the centrality of Nietzsche for Heidegger's own thinking.

 On Nietzsche's genealogical mode of inquiry	 Merrick, Allison M.	 University of Southampton	 University of Southampton	2009	The subject of this thesis is Friedrich Nietzsche’s methodology, the genealogical mode of inquiry, which came to fruition in On the Genealogy of Morals. The precise nature of the genealogy, as a mode of inquiry, is a site of contest amongst scholars, with the central debates pivoting around four questions which arise upon considering the methodology: (1) what is the critical import of Nietzsche’s genealogical mode of inquiry? (2) What form of critique does it take? (3) To whom does Nietzsche address his reflections? And (4) what role, if any, does history play in Nietzsche’s genealogical narratives? Accordingly, this thesis seeks to offer and to defend answers to the central questions that are generated by the consideration of Nietzsche’s methodology. In order to get a foothold into these debates and to provide the boundary within which these disagreements occur the first chapter has as its object of inquiry an examination and evaluation of Nietzsche scholars’ responses to these issues. In chapter two I defend my interpretation against these rival views, and contend that the genealogy takes the form of an immanent critique, and that it is intended, at least, to reach all of Nietzsche’s contemporaries. The adage “genealogy is history correctly practiced” is treated in the remaining three chapters, in which I attempt to morph what appears to be at present an uninformative formulation into an informative one by arguing that for Nietzsche historiography is best seen as a form of artistry. And, this I submit, serves to shed light upon the genealogical mode of inquiry, and to shape the boundary by which the equation of genealogy as methodology with history becomes instructive. 3.

 Montesquieu's idea of justice	 Mason, Sheila Mary	 Royal Holloway, University of London	 University of London	1971	Part One of Montesquieu's Idea of Justice comprises a survey of the currency in philosophical, ethical and aesthetic debate during the second half of the 17th century of the terms rapport and convenance, which are central to the enigmatic definition given to justice by Montesquieu in Lettres Persanes LXXXIII. In this survey, attention is concentrated on the way in which the connotations of these terms fluctuate with the divergent development of the methodological and speculative outgrowths of Cartesianism into two schools of thought, materialist and idealist, often widely at variance in their views of the nature and organization of the universe. In Part Two, Montesquieu's definition of justice is set against this background whose doctrinal conflicts because of the characteristic associations of its key terms it may be taken to reflect, just as it may be held to epitomize, by virtue of its elaboration in the opening chapter of De 1'Esprit des Lois and its close terminological affinities with the definition of law there given, an undoubtedly related conflict between the implications of causal determinism and the aspirations of idealist metaphysics surviving at the heart of Montesquieu's outlook, and, remaining unresolved, often said to impair the coherence if not the validity of his theory of society. The reconstitution of the philosophical matrix of the definition which is now undertaken, drawing largely on the fragmentary evidence of Montesquieu's notebooks and his minor works, demonstrates however by clarifying his intellectual allegiances and his methodological procedures that, far from internal inconsistency, his idea of justice represents a fruitful interpenetration of the philosophical currents of his time. The union within it of the epistemological assumptions of contemporary empiricism contained in the notion of relationship with the transcendent if elusive ideal of fitness, summarizes in a single formula his double achievement of dignifying his scientific thesis with serious moral aspirations, while at the same time founding this idealism on a solid empirical groundwork, Montesquieu's idea of justice holds the key to establishing the unity of his thought and also offers his posterity an escape from the blind alley of determinism.

 Anxiety's ambiguity : via Kierkegaard 	 Haynes, Jeffrey	 University of Essex	 University of Essex	2016	 This dissertation produces a systematic account of anxiety, and does so by way of interpreting the account of anxiety given to us by Kierkegaard and Heidegger. The methodology of this dissertation is such that it interprets the anxiety in Kierkegaard through Heidegger’s lens, and also interprets the anxiety in Heidegger through Kierkegaard’s lens. By this method this dissertation harmonizes the accounts of anxiety in Kierkegaard and Heidegger, and in this way produces a systematic account of anxiety by way of these two authors. In particular, this dissertation argues that anxiety in both Kierkegaard and Heidegger has a particular structure: that it is ambiguous, which means that it is structurally constituted by an antipathy (a repulsion) and a sympathy (an attraction). In harmonizing Kierkegaard’s and Heidegger’s accounts of anxiety in this way, this dissertation produces a systematic account of ambiguous anxiety.

 Liberal trusteeship : preparatory work for an epistemic defence of non-egalitarian liberalism	 Dagkas-Tsoukalas, Vladimiros	 University of St Andrews	 University of St Andrews	2017	 This thesis examines some epistemic defences of democracy put forward by David Estlund, Michael Fuerstein, Cheryl Misak, and Fabienne Peter, as well as a critique of democracy raised by Jason Brennan. It then develops an epistemic defence of a moderately non-egalitarian system, which it proposes to call liberal trusteeship. According to the proposed theory, the power to draft laws ought to be separated from the power to enact those drafts into law. The former power ought to be vested in trustees, who are essentially specialists that have inquired extensively into a given matter, and the latter power ought to be vested in a democratically elected parliament. Subsequently, this thesis argues that parliament should nevertheless have the prerogative to ultimately override trustees on ethics and pass its own legislation regulating moral matters; that the criteria for selecting trustees should be determined by jury courts; and that parliament and jury courts should be given some powers to influence the composition of trustee committees, so that the political process can guard against the risk that trustees might be biased or corrupt. The above proposal is grounded on three principal claims. Firstly, this thesis argues that moral authority and legitimacy ought to be reserved for the political system that strikes the best balance between competence and equality. Secondly, it argues that liberal trusteeship is more likely than democracy to determine correctly what ought to be done in light of the progress of open and vigorous inquiry into a given matter. Thirdly, and as a result, it argues that liberal trusteeship is likely to exercise power sufficiently more competently than democracy, such that its moderate deviation from political equality will be justified. In the light of this, the thesis concludes that liberal trusteeship would strike a better balance between competence and equality than democracy.

 The eclipse of being : Heidegger on the question of being and nothing and the ground of nihilism	 Bani, Nayère	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	2002	 This thesis explores Heidegger’s philosophy of Being and Nothing in the context of the problem of nihilism. Nietzsche diagnosed the present age as an age of nihilism in the sense of a ‘devaluation of the highest values’. Heidegger argues that Nietzsches’s diagnosis suffers from a fundamental failure to question the meaning of ‘nihil’ in ‘nihilism’. This failure is, according to Heidegger, shared by the history of metaphysics which Nietzsche brings to completion, and it is closely connected with the failure of metaphysics to address the question of Being as such. We shall examine the emergence of Heidegger’s early phenomenological approach to the question of Being in his engagement and confrontation with Husserl’s phenomenology, and trace its subsequent development in major writings of his. It will be argued that Heidegger’s philosophy of Being permits for the first time a more adequate understanding of the problem of Nothing. Throughout the thesis, the horizon of the discussion is the question of the meaning and the ground of nihilism, which will also be addressed explicitly through an examination of Heidegger’s confrontation with Nietzsche.

The content, context and influence of the work of Juan Luis Vives (1492-1540)	 Skelton, Fiona	 University of Glasgow	 University of Glasgow	1996	The aim of this thesis is to examine the educational and psychological theories of the renaissance philosopher Juan Luis Vives. A brief history of Vives' life is given as background information and, to place his work in context, the central concepts of Renaissance Humanism are explained. As Vives was influenced by Desiderius Erasmus and by the central tenets of Northern Humanism, information is given on these subjects. The main focus of the research is a study of Vives' pedagogy and psychology as set out in the texts De institutione foeminae Christianae, De tradendis disciplinis and De anima et vita. Vives' educational work is discussed in Chapters 4 and 5, and comparison is made with other renaissance theories of education. It will be explained that his educational philosophy rests upon his theory of the soul. This led him to consider such things as the role of memory in the learning process, the need to take account of children's psychological maturation when planning a course of study, and the way in which sensate information is 'translated' into percepts. Chapter 6 deals with Vives' treatise on psychological processes (De anima et vita) and includes description and analysis of his epistemology together with his examination of the 'passions' and their effect on cognitive functioning. It will be argued in Chapters 7 and 8 that aspects of Vives' work are forerunners of later theories: specifically, the philosophy of Pierre Gassendi, the study of the soul by René Descartes, and the pedagogy of John Locke. Gassendi was instrumental in reviving interest in Epicurianism and in the work of Sextus Emipricus. (DXN004,921)	 Thesis or dissertation	 B Philosophy (General)	297032	1
 Jewish hermeneutics of divine testing with special reference to the epistle of James	 Ellis, Nicholas J.	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2013	The nature of trials, tests, and temptation in the Epistle of James has been extensively debated in New Testament scholarship. However, scholarship has underexamined the tension between the author’s mitigation of divine agency in testing ( Jas 1:13–14) and the author’s appeal to well-known biblical testing narratives such as the creation account (1:15– 18), the Binding of Isaac ( Jas 2:21–24), and the Trials of Job ( Jas 5:9–11). is juxtaposition between the author’s theological apologetic and his biblical hermeneutic has the potential to reveal either the author’s theological incoherence or his rhetorical and hermeneutical creativity. With these tensions of divine agency and biblical interpretation in mind, this dissertation compares the Epistle of James against other examples of ancient Jewish interpretation, interrogating two points of contact in each Jewish work: their portrayals of the cosmic drama of testing, and their resulting biblical hermeneutic. The dissertation assembles a spectrum of positions on how the divine, satanic, and human roles of testing vary from author to author. These variations of the dramatis personae of the cosmic drama exercise a direct influence on the reception and interpretation of the biblical testing narratives. When the Epistle of James is examined in a similar light, it reveals a cosmic drama especially dependent on the metaphor of the divine law court. Within this cosmic drama, God stands as righteous judge, and in the place of divine prosecutor stand the cosmic forces indicting both divine integrity and human religious loyalty. These cosmic and human roles have a direct impact on James’ reading of biblical testing narratives. Utilising an intra-canonical hermeneutic similar to that found in Rewritten Bible literature, the Epistle appeals to a constructed ‘Jobraham’ narrative in which the Job stories mitigate divine agency in biblical trials such as those of Abraham, and Abraham’s celebrated patience rehabilitates Job’s rebellious response to trial. In conclusion, by closely examining the broader exegetical discourses of ancient Judaism, this project sheds new light on how the Epistle of James responds to theological tensions within its religious community through a hermeneutical application of the dominant biblical narratives of Job’s cosmic framework and Abraham’s human perfection.

 Wholeness and internal relatedness : a Bradleyan critique of recent holistic metaphysics	 Briceño Domínguez, José Sebastián	 University of Nottingham	 University of Nottingham	2015	 According to David Lewis’ influential thesis of Humean Supervenience, the world is a plurality of self-contained individuals standing in external relations of spatiotemporal distance. In the last decades, this thesis has been under attack by what I call ‘holistic ontologies’, the most salient of which are Dispositional Essentialism, Ontic Structural Realism, Priority Monism, and Existence Monism. These reactions obey different but closely related suspicions against the central features of Humean Supervenience. On one hand, there are suspicions against the idea of external relations; on the other hand, there are suspicions against the idea of self-contained plurals. Common to these holistic ontologies is to conceive the world not as an externally related heap but, in different degrees of strength, as an ‘internally related whole’. This work, following Bradley’s stance against relations, puts under critical scrutiny the merits of these holistic ontologies. The central aims are to make explicit the different senses of ‘wholeness’ and ‘internal relatedness’ that they happen to endorse; make explicit their internal flaws; and show the relative superiority of Existence Monism. As it happens, Existence Monism vindicates Bradley’s core ideas about relations, namely: that external relations are unable to relate; that internal relations are inherently unstable; and that all relations–external and internal–are better understood as imperfect abstractions from a more substantial, non-relational, kind of unity. I conclude with some skeptical remarks against my own metaphysical preferences and against ontology in general.	 Thesis or dissertation	 B Philosophy (General) ; BD Speculative philosophy	674818	1
 Full-bloodedness, modesty and minimalist truth	 Billinge, Daniel	 University of St Andrews	 University of St Andrews	2016	 This thesis discusses the central ideas that surround Michael Dummett's claim that there is an incompatibility between a truth-conditional conception of meaning and a minimalist conception of truth. These ideas are brought into relation to the work of John McDowell and Donald Davidson, as all three philosophers can be better understood by locating them within Dummett's dialectic regarding the incompatibility. Dummett's argument crucially depends upon the assumption that a meaning-theory should be full-blooded in nature, against McDowell's insistence that a meaning-theory can only ever be modest. The main contention of this thesis is that neither Dummett nor McDowell is successful in establishing their strong contentions regarding the form that a meaning-theory should take. McDowell only wants to provide trivial answers to questions about the constitutive nature of the meanings and competency of particular items in a language. Dummett, on the other hand, wants to provide a reductive account of the central concepts that concern the philosophy of language. What this thesis will argue is that once both of these claims have been rejected, the position Dummett and McDowell jointly dictate is in fact the position that we should read Davidson as occupying, who lies in a conceptual space between the extremes of maximal full-bloodedness and modesty. This is an understanding of Davidson that is contrary to how McDowell reads him, who has been an influential commentator of Davidson. How Davidson should actually be interpreted is achieved by understanding how he has the resources to avoid Dummett's claim of an incompatibility between a truth-conditional conception of meaning and a minimalist conception of truth.

 Of poems and propositions : T.S. Eliot and the linguistic turn	 Pierce, April Elisabeth	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2015	This thesis describes how Eliot's concern for language and form finds roots in early twentieth century language philosophy. It also explores the way Eliot's early philosophical themes concerning language and meaning reemerge in his literary criticism and philosophical poetry during the 1920s and 1930s, and in his more explicitly philosophical Four Quartets. More significantly, this thesis historically elucidates Eliot's debt to the philosophies of Edmund Husserl and Bertrand Russell, reframing his philosophy within the two poles of the "Linguistic Turn". By closely examining Eliot's unpublished and only recently published essays and notes, the thesis unearths probable connections between Eliot's own philosophical interests and his later poetics, redefining his legacy as a prototypical modernist poet, and suggesting a new framework of study for scholars and students of literary modernism.

 Mind out of action : the intentionality of automatic actions	 Di Nucci, Ezio	 University of Edinburgh	 University of Edinburgh	2008	 We think less than we think. My thesis moves from this suspicion to show that standard accounts of intentional action can't explain the whole of agency. Causalist accounts such as Davidson's and Bratman's, according to which an action can be intentional only if it is caused by a particular mental state of the agent, don't work for every kind of action. So-called automatic actions, effortless performances over which the agent doesn't deliberate, and to which she doesn't need to pay attention, constitute exceptions to the causalist framework, or so I argue in this thesis. Not all actions are the result of a mental struggle, painful hesitation, or the weighting of evidence. Through practice, many performances become second nature. Think of familiar cases such as one's morning routines and habits: turning on the radio, brushing your teeth. Think of the highly skilled performances involved in sport and music: Jarrett's improvised piano playing, the footballer's touch. Think of agents' spontaneous reactions to their environment: ducking a blow, smiling. Psychological research has long acknowledged the distinctiveness and importance of automatic actions, while philosophy has so far explained them together with the rest of agency. Intuition tells us that automatic actions are intentional actions of ours all the same (I have run a survey which shows that this intuition is widely shared): not only our own autonomous deeds for which we are held responsible, but also necessary components in the execution and satisfaction of our general plans and goals. But do standard causal accounts deliver on the intentionality of automatic actions? I think not. Because, in automatic cases, standard appeals to intentions, beliefs, desires, and psychological states in general ring hollow. We just act: we don't think, either consciously or unconsciously. On the reductive side, Davidson's view can't but appeal to, at best, unconscious psychological states, the presence and causal role of which is, I argue, inferred from the needs of a theory, rather than from evidence in the world. On the non-reductive side, Bratman agrees, with his refutation of the Simple View, that we can't just attach an intention to every action that we want to explain. But Bratman’s own Single Phenomenon View, appealing to the mysterious notion of 'motivational potential', merely acknowledges the need for refinement without actually providing one. So I propose my own account of intentional action, the 'guidance view', according to which automatic actions are intentional: differently from Davidson and Bratman, who only offer necessary conditions in order to avoid the problem of causal deviance, I offer a full-blown account: E's phi-ing is intentional if and only If phi-ing is under E's guidance. This account resembles one developed by Frankfurt, with the crucial difference that Frankfurt – taking 'acting with an intention' and 'acting intentionally' to be synonymous – thinks that guidance is sufficient only for some movement being an action, but not for some movement being an intentional action. I argue that, on the other hand, Frankfurt's concept of guidance can be developed so that it is sufficient for intentional action too. In Chapter One I present and defend my definition of ‘automatic action’. In Chapter Two I show that such understanding of automatic actions finds confirmation in empirical psychology. In Chapter Three I show that Davidson's reductive account of intentional action does not work for automatic actions. In Chapter Four I show that the two most influential non-reductive accounts of intentional action, the Simple View and Bratman's Single Phenomenon View, don't work either. And in Chapter Five I put forward and defend my positive thesis, the 'guidance view'. Also, in the Appendix I present the findings of my survey on the intentionality of automatic actions.

 One and many : rethinking John Hick's pluralism	 Lee, Yen-Yi	 University of Birmingham	 University of Birmingham	2012	 As its criticisms have revealed, a closer look at the concept of the Real, the thesis of “all experiencing is experiencing-as,” and the criterion of the soteriological transformation have shown some difficulities in John Hick’s pluralistic hypothesis. Focusing on the theory of religious experience contended by Hick, this research explores the Kantian and Wittgensteinian elements of his hypothesis to ease the tension between its metaphysical and epistemological aspects. Since Hick’s hypothesis is based on the doctrines of religions within the Indo-European language group, this research introduces those traditions from outside this group to rethink its criteriology. These two attempts inevitably call for a refined model of Hick’s hypothesis. Both Hick’s hypothesis and the refined model reflect certain understandings of the notion of Religion. Meanwhile, every religious tradition also manifests its various dimensions. This research consequently suggests that the ideal of Religion can be considered in terms of the idea of functional unity and can be taken as the regulative principle to direct any model of religious pluralism, which is subject to be modified when it encounters any “anomalies” of religious phenomena -- this pattern can be further illustrated in light of the Confucian proposition of “the Li is one but its manifestations are many (理一分殊li-yi-fen-shu).”	 Thesis or dissertation	 B Philosophy (General) ; BL Religion	549894	1
 Logic and logogrif in German idealism : an investigation into the notion of experience in Kant, Fichte, Schelling	 Goudeli, Kyriaki	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	1999	 In this thesis I investigate the notion of experience in German Idealist Philosophy. I focus on the exploration of an alternative to the transcendental model notion of experience through Schelling's insight into the notion of logogrif. The structural division of this project into two sections reflects the two theoretical standpoints of this project, namely the logic and the logogrif of experience. The first section - the logic of experience - explores the notion of experience provided in Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, Critique of Judgement and Fichte's Science of Knowledge. I argue that Kant's fundamental question about the possibility of synthetic a priori judgements succeeds in thematising the aporia of cognitive experience but results in a subject-oriented, representational model which radically confines the notion of experience to the constitutive laws of the understanding or to the normative precepts of Reason. Experience is founded upon a sharp division between faith and knowledge, will and logic, desire and reflection, absolute and finitude. Fichte's endeavour to articulate a non-representational account of experience, does not succeed in extricating itself from the representational model, so long as experience is reduced to the ever-producing deeds of the self-positing ego. Despite the serious differences between Kant's and Fichte's notions of experience, both accounts, so long as they unfold from a transcendental standpoint, attempt to resolve experience into conceptual laws or determinations of the ego's absolute will. Experience is transformed into an object of the subject's cognitive or volitional faculties. The paradoxes of man's interaction with the world are intended to be accommodated either by the law-giving spontaneity of the understanding and the Architectonic of Pure Reason or by the overpowerful primordial act of the self-positing ego. This implies the conceptualisation of the self in terms of constant identity-through-time, or sheer self-determination. However, this conceptualisation remains at the normative or prescriptive level, which in turn is projected upon the world. The latter, though appears as the subject's property, essentially remains alien and opaque, confirming the radical limitations of the ego rather than its order-giving authority. Moreover, this notion of experience is ultimately founded upon a radical expulsion of the divine from the world, the de-spiritualisation of the sensual and the de-sensualisation of the spiritual, the sharp juxtaposition between absolute and finitude. This results in a self-defeating subjectivity, whose firm identity and rule-giving authority does not rescue it from its perennial unattainability to 'organise the conditioned' or 'conquer the unconditioned'. In Kant's and Fichte's thought, however, I detect elements that potentially transgress their transcendental account of experience. These are found in Kant's concept of spontaneity and free play between understanding and imagination, and Fichte's concept of productivity. I argue that these elements lose their potential dynamism, so long as they are absorbed by the transcendental demands for the solution of the aporias of logic. However, these elements point to the need for a radical re-conceptualisation of the notion of experience. This is provided by means of Schelling's logogriflic approach, which constitutes the theme of the second section. The second section - the logogrif of experience - attempts to articulate a different approach towards the notion of experience, through an exploration of Schelling's versatile and provocative thought. This section focuses on Schelling's original insight into the notion and act of logogrif, which opens the dialogue between logos and mythos, cosmic becoming and human soul, cosmic imagination and human reflection, faith and knowledge. This section attempts to illuminate Schelling's fascinating philosophical investigations and discoveries that have been rather overlooked, possibly, due to Hegel's overwhelming critique. This section, after a brief critical examination of the Identity Philosophy, attempts to elucidate Schelling's notion of experience through his middle works, Of Human Freedom, Ages of the World, The Deities of Samothrace, which are treated as a self-developing trilogy. Schelling re-addresses the aporias of logic not as part of Reason's self-interrogation but as part of the cosmic paradoxes and living experiences. In this way, Schelling resets the scene of the debate on the conditions of possibility for cognitive experience by putting on the stage the enigmas of the cosmos and life rather than the Tribunal of Reason. Logic itself is conceived as a potency in the cosmic becoming, and consequently can no longer attempt to establish the transcendental conditions for the possibility of cognitive experience. Cosmic becoming, in which man is an active part, is conceived as the process of the movement, the interaction, the transformations and transmutations of multiple potencies. These, far beyond any mechanical conceptualisation, appear as self-moving and yet interdependent, unknown yet familiar, inscrutable and yet manifest powers, describing the mystery of life itself. The latter is depicted as an ever-recurrent act of longing for self-expression as active unity. Experience is conceived as the lived process of a network of living potencies, which may not only resist rational powers but may also puzzle and seize them. In this context, reflection acquires a plastic dimension, as opposed to its rigidity in the representational model of experience. Reflection depicts cosmic longing's self-formation, whose man is part. This self-bending formation partially illuminates the nature of longing, and from this standpoint is the logic of the longing. However, this formation is movable, transmutable and mostly ineffable, and from this standpoint is the logic of a riddle: a logogrif. Logogrif is the transitive term that attempts to describe the transition of experience from its enacted phase to its allusive conceptual utterance, and in this sense the term itself participates in both phases, as both form of thought and form of life. The logogrific approach to experience in turn transposes us as from the realm of pure concepts to the realm of the mystery of life, from pure thought to acts of longing, from the Architectonic of Pure Reason to Cosmic Theurgy. The latter term attempts to grasp the paradox and dynamism of cosmic and non-cosmic becoming by means of multiple, vanishing and ever-recurring, transmutable potencies, or in Schelling's terms 'the magic of insoluble life'. Schelling's logogrific account consists in a powerful voice for the re-enchantment of the world, the introduction into the notion of experience of the imminence of the divine. This is not suggested in terms of the adoption of old religious doctrines but by means of the discovery and re-discovery of the theurgy of life, through the intensification of our artistic mood, the creative expansion of our deeds. This notion of experience allows for the reconsideration of the notion of the self, in terms of a dynamic, conflictual process between conscious and unconscious powers and the critical revaluation of the accounts of subjectivity which reduce it to the sphere of self-consciousness. The thesis concludes with the need for an investigation into the relation between logos and mythos, which only tangentially has been introduced by the present project. In this context it will be possible to re-appraise the potential that the logogrific approach opens for an alternative to both logical and traditional mythological patterns of thinking.

 The feminist postmodern fantastic : sexed, gendered, and sexual identities	 Denby, Michelle	 University of Leicester	 University of Leicester	2001	 The thesis investigates a diverse range of feminist postmodern philosophy, distinguished by its varying rearticulation of the relationship between modernism and postmodernism and feminism's own position vis-a-vis that debate. Drawing on postmodernism's primary tenet that substantive, binary identity categories comprise discursive, performative constructs, feminist postmodernism theorises a range of strategies for their subversive re-performance. This is realised in the mobilisation of parodic, "failed" repetitions and identities embodied, for instance, by transsexual, transgender, and transvestite personae. Hence the reformulation of postmodern versions of agency, resistance, and choice. In the second instance, the thesis examines the combination of feminist postmodern philosophy with the narrative techniques of postmodernism and its sister genre, the fantastic mode. As a heterogeneous, open-ended, self-reflexive form, the "postmodern fantastic" challenges conventional realism and its correlative sovereign subject. The postmodern fantastic is redeployed by feminist practitioners, whose inscription of both textual and topographical re-performance, such as is manifest in the cyborg and the grotesque, represent the literary counterparts of feminist postmodern agency. The above provide critical contexts for a reading of four late-twentieth-century women writers, focusing in particular on their intervention in the modernism/postmodernism debate and their deployment of the feminist postmodern fantastic as a means of destabilising sexed, gendered, and sexual identity. The selected authors - Helene Cixous, Monique Wittig, Jeanette Winterson, and Angela Carter - represent distinct and diverse, culturally specific, literary and feminist traditions, reformulating the relationship between modernism and postmodernism in different ways and with varying degrees of success. They coalesce, however, in their contribution to the feminist postmodern fantastic. It is the general purpose of the thesis to demonstrate how this particular mode embodies one of feminist postmodernism's most powerful means of literary and ideological critique.

 The ancient Greek influence on Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy of education	 Hart, Thomas Edward	 Durham University	 Durham University	2002	 From early in his life Friedrich Nietzsche had a deep and abiding concern for the state of educational practices and cultural development because he felt that the educational system lacked the necessary structure and philosophy to facilitate what he called true culture. His studies of the ancient Greeks led him to an understanding of the importance of the agonistic nature of culture and reality. In the development of his larger philosophical project he saw this knowledge of antiquity as the means for developing contemporary culture and education. In this dissertation I will demonstrate the ancient Greek legacy in Nietzsche's philosophy and that his pedagogical thought is both the foundation of and consistent with his mature philosophical position. In order to achieve this I will begin by looking at the work that Nietzsche did during the period of his active service as the chair of Classical Philology at the University of Basle. I will then move on to the philosophical development of the central questions surrounding history and culture as these relate to education in Nietzsche's thought. This will be followed by an analysis of the connection between Protagoras, Gorgias, Heraclitus and Nietzsche with regard to the central concepts of epistemology and becoming! And finally, I will set out what I take to be the composition and structure of Nietzsche's philosophy of education as this relates to the ideas developed throughout this dissertation. I hope to show that Nietzsche's pedagogical philosophy is best understood as the origin of the concerns and ideas that make up his larger philosophical project and that this is in mm best-read in the context of the tradition of which it is a development and extension, the sophistic tradition of practical and subjective thought.

 Rationality, decisions and large worlds	 Drechsler, Mareile	 London School of Economics and Political Science (University of London)	 London School of Economics and Political Science (University of London)	2012	Taking Savage's (1954) subjective expected utility theory as a starting point, this thesis distinguishes three types of uncertainty which are incompatible with Savage's theory for small worlds: ambiguity, option uncertainty and state space uncertainty. Under ambiguity agents cannot form a unique and additive probability function over the state space. Option uncertainty exists when agents cannot assign unique consequences to every state. Finally, state space uncertainty arises when the state space the agent constructs is not exhaustive, such that unforeseen contingencies can occur. Chapter 2 explains Savage's notions of small and large worlds, and shows that ambiguity, option and state space uncertainty are incompatible with the small world representation. The chapter examines whether it is possible to reduce these types of uncertainty to one another. Chapter 3 suggests a definition of objective ambiguity by extending Savage's framework to include an exogenous likelihood ranking over events. The definition allows for a precise distinction between ambiguity and ambiguity attitude. The chapter argues that under objective ambiguity, ambiguity aversion is normatively permissible. Chapter 4 gives a model of option uncertainty. Using the two weak assumptions that the status quo is not uncertain, and that agents are option uncertainty averse, we derive status quo bias, the empirical tendency for agents to choose the status quo over other available alternatives. The model can be seen as rationalising status quo bias. Chapter 5 gives an axiomatic characterisation and corresponding representation theorem for the priority heuristic, a heuristic which predicts binary decisions be- tween lotteries particularly well. The chapter analyses the normative implications of this descriptive model. Chapter 6 defends the pluralist view of decision theory this thesis assumes.

 Nietzsche and rhetoric	 Watt, Alan Norman	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	1992	 The thesis maintained here is that Nietzsche belongs to and revitalizes a rhetorical tradition which has competed with philosophy for cultural and educational dominance. The general strategy of the thesis is to draw comparisons between Nietzsche and those aspects of the Sophists' activity that were attacked by Plato, in order to challenge philosophy's claim to moral and intellectual superiority over rhetoric. The first chapter considers the allegation that philosophy is demonstrably superior to rhetoric because it has a proper method and can achieve positive results. Against this, it is argued that philosophy is distinguished from rhetoric by its values, not its methodological purity; the remaining chapters probe this conflict of values. Chapter two explores the charge that rhetoric is both manipulative and open to manipulation, notes how Nietzsche's texts have been subject to these two criticisms, and counters them by challenging philosophy's models of manipulation and education. Chapter three examines the rival educational ideals of philosophy and rhetoric, arguing that the key differentiating feature is rhetoric's pragmatism. It shows how this feature has been used to disparage rhetoric, and argues that Nietzsche develops a form of pragmatism that meets the philosophical attack effectively. Chapter four considers the suggestion that rhetoric is less rational than philosophy because it employs looser argumentation, and argues that, at least as manifested by Nietzsche, rhetorical argumentation produces a superior rationality - according to an alternative perspective on reason and science. Chapter five considers the claim that the eloquence of rhetoric is to be condemned for seducing and confusing the seeker after truth; this is countered by developing the Nietzschean dictum that art is worth more than truth. The main conclusion is that, through Nietzsche's development of the ancient tradition, rhetoric emerges as a real alternative "love of wisdom".

 The normative ethics of immigration detention in liberal states	 Silverman, Stephanie J.	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2013	 This thesis explores the normative propriety of immigration detention in liberal states. In the first part of the thesis, I explore the development, current practice, and popular justifications for immigration detention in the United Kingdom. I argue that a crucial but unacknowledged role for immigration detention is to function as a political spectacle of the centralisation of power in liberal states. I find that the key motivation for detaining non-citizens is that they could abscond before their removals. I conclude that this basis for detention is normatively acceptable in only very limited cases and, even then, alternatives are often available and ethically preferable. Based on the fact that there is a normatively acceptable rationale, albeit circumscribed, for detention practices, I then propose a framework of minimum standards of treatment in detention that I advise all liberal states to follow. After outlining my proposal, I turn in the second part of the thesis to an examination of the normative theories of immigration control and how they take account of detention. Normative theorists differ in how they balance their commitments to individual and state rights, yet I find the majority concedes the need for some degree of immigration admissions control. Such theories face a moral dilemma: there can be no immigration control without detention, and so detention becomes an implicit assumption for these normative theories to be coherent. A potential solution for combating the practical problems associated with the growing, worsening detention estates as well as the moral dilemma of incarcerating a non-citizen based on fear of absconding would be to open borders and eliminate immigration control. Given the reality of the sovereign right to control immigration, however, I argue that the more feasible normative answer is lobby liberal states to adopt my framework of minimum standards of treatment while simultaneously pressing for open borders as the long-term ethical goal.

 The triune conversation : trinitarian description and theological ontology in Robert W. Jenson's 'Systematic theology'	 Gatewood, Thomas S.	 University of St Andrews	 University of St Andrews	2005	 This thesis proposes that Robert W. Jenson's identification of the triune God faithfully describes the persons and being of God. To support this I examine the most basic argument of Jenson's 'Systematic Theology',: that God is freely but truly identified by and with Jesus Christ. This includes discussion of Jenson's starting point, his formal description of the three persons of God, and the theological ontology that this entails. Throughout I argue that Jenson's trinitarian description and theological ontology is rightly controlled by an a posteriori logic of response to the triune God's actual life with and for his people. Central to this is the way that Jenson creatively and courageously uses Jesus Christ's life and person as the controlling criterion of all dogmatic statements about God. Finally, this thesis proposes that Jenson's basic insights are made more exact when Jesus Christ is recognized in his perfect relation with the Father and Spirit before, in and after created history. To elucidate this suggestion the nature of the triune God's election and self-determination is reconsidered in light of Jenson's critical insight that the persons are mutually, not identically, perfect in deity. This in turn leads to a brief description of the eternity and freedom of the triune conversation that begins and ends with the Word who is Jesus Christ.

 The temporality of language : Kant's legacy in the work of Martin Heidegger and Walter Benjamin	 Lyne, Ian	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	1995	 Contrary to the idea that there are fundamental differences between the work of Martin Heidegger and Walter Benjamin, the thesis shows that there exists a profound similarity in the direction of their projects, by exploring how they took up Kant's critical legacy concerning the temporality of language: the belonging together of language and time. The ground of Kant's system and of the necessity of systematicity - the three-fold synthesis which 'generates' time under the direction of conceptuality - is elucidated via the Second Analogy and the Critique of Teleological Judgment. It is argued that Kant's understanding of language and time remains fixed within a circular justification of Newtonian Science, which prevented him from taking up the critical resources of his treatment of teleological concepts and applying it to his idea of the critical system itself. Heidegger's and Benjamin's work may be understood as taking up the hermeneutic circularity of Kant's philosophical system, though freeing it from its appeal to a limited time determination. They both develop notions of a more originary temporality in conjunction with a linguistic phenomenology. They further allow this more critical thinking of language and time to reflexively fall back on the writing of philosophy itself. Their understanding of the temporality of language is explored through the way 'translation' focuses, in each case, a thinking of tradition and of linguistic works. The thesis rejects attempts to separate Heidegger's early work from his later approach, and further rejects a tendency to focus on Benjamin's style of writing in isolation from its theoretical basis. The thesis concludes by arguing that the work of both Heidegger and Benjamin points to a rethinking of Kant's legacy of the necessity of system, in terms of system as the inescapable belonging together of language and time.

 Interpreting the law : a reassessment of the dichotomy between the law and its readings	 Polat, Necati	 University of Nottingham	 University of Nottingham	1993	The purpose of this thesis is to pursue a grammatical, common sense, reading of some of the contemporary accounts of the workings of law. In so doing it relies extensively on the critical work by Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Derrida, and Stanley Fish, writers assumed to present a somewhat unified perspective on such matters as understanding, language, meaning and reading. The shorter of the two parts, 'Judgement, Criteria, Justice,' sets the stage. Looking at Jean-Franςois Lyotard's discourse, in Just Gaming, of a semantic and moral apocalypse, and his subsequent search for a concept of the just, the first part introduces the principal themes of the essay. These themes at once form some of the major concerns of the contemporary legal theory; the text of the law, the authorial intention, the politics of interpretation, the interpreter, and the limits of interpretation. Chapter 1.1 probes the concept of authorship as formulated by Lyotard. According to him, the modern situation produces a concept of the author that is detached. The modem situation lacks the transparency that characterizes the classical situation, where the author and the reader could relate to one another, and where, therefore, interpretation was a possibility. The Lyotardian concept radically distinguishes between the realms of the author and of the audience, a distinction that suppresses the ineluctably fraternal, attached quality of authorship. Chapter 1.2 is a critique of the concept of judgement Lyotard advances. It explores the two distinct orders within which, according to Lyotard, judgement is practicable: those of faith ('the Jewish pole') and paganism. While both orders exclude the concept of an autonomous subject - a false order which defines the rhetoric of the mainstream Western thought - the homogenous formalism of one, faith, contrasts with the heterogenous localism of the other, the pagan attitude. Questioning the dichotomy, the discussion goes on to argue for a concept of the primordiality of the attached, situated, quality of both the issuing of the judgement and of its possible interpretations, irrespective of the distinct orders of rhetoric – autonomous, heterogenous, religious - in which they are presented. Chapter 1.3 explores the Lyotardian reworking of Kant's categorical imperative and seeks to point out the problematic nature of the enterprise. The discussion questions the idea that a thematic, non-moral, non-political, concept of the just may necessarily function better than one which is of common opinion, and indicates the illusory character of the Lyotardian venture radically to contrast what would be a thematic concept of the just with that which is mere common opinion. Chapter 1.4 continues on the subject of the politics of interpretation - can what would be the unruly, fantastic dictates of morals be avoided on the basis of a universalistic, politics-free, criterion? - to test the opposition Lyotard draws between the Sophistic and the Kantian positions. While from the Sophistic viewpoint a genuine opposition of competing moralities is not a possibility, the Kantian morality makes conceivable the concept of a rational, as opposed to mere opinion-based and rhetorical, choice. The longer part, The Law and Its Readings,' is a reading of some of the motifs of Franςois Gény's Method of Interpretation and Sources of Private Positive Law. Each of the four chapters that make the second part aims to dissolve one of the four binary oppositions that characterize the contemporary scene - polarities that are strictly mere variations on the theme of the dichotomy between the law and its readings, the law and that which is made of it: the text and the extratext, intention and extension, the tame and the freakish, the real and the formal. In the four chapters that form the second part, the logic behind the oppositions is explored, and a grammatical reassessment, which indicates the terms of each one of the polarities ultimately metamorphic and elusive, though, naturally, of possible grammatical use, is suggested. Chapter 2.1 examines some of the contemporary arguments relating to the text of the law. Extratextualist positions such as, famously, Gény's counter the mainstream textualist positions by arguing against the mechanistic conception of the law that is written, all inclusive, and once and for all. Curiously, however, the notion of the law therefore invoked presupposes a notion of the text which might best suit the formalism of the mainstream positions - namely that the text, as opposed to what might tentatively be called history, is the locus of meaning. What follows this markedly positivistic notion of the text, a notion invoked in particular in the extratextualist positions on the interpretation of the American Constitution, is a fear of judgement that would be made on the basis of what is often (as in the segregation cases) an obsolete concept embodied in the text. This fear, in fact, is not different from the formalistic, mainstream-textualistic, fear of what would become of the law in the absence of formally circumscribed, textual, constraints. In exploring the theme, the discussion focuses on certain individual cases, such as the segregation cases of the U.S. Supreme Court, arguments over which have been an integral part of the theory. Chapter 2.2 is devoted to the considerations of the legislative will. Counterintentionalist positions regarding the interpretation of the law, it argues, may in fact suggest an inherent intentionalism, as epistemologically understood, which may in turn point in the direction of a reversal not dissimilar to that of the binary opposition of textualism and extratextualism. The traditional arguments against the mainstream intentionalism seem to gather on two points: first, that intention is a state of mind and therefore impossible to uncover for those who do not have a natural access inside others' heads; and secondly, that even if it were possible to uncover it, what one has with the legislative will is but a fiction, for it refers to, not one, but many minds who could not possibly intent one and the same thing. The discussion seeks to disclose the way counter-intentionalist arguments subscribe to traditional intentionalism by assuming intention as an occult presence, to use two concepts, one Wittgesteinean and one Derridean, together. And it argues how intention as a concept is a possibility precisely because it is in each case a collegiate, fraternal extension. Chapter 2.3 explores the problems of judicial discretion, politics, and the politics of interpretation. It discusses some of the traditional criticisms of judicial review, in particular the countermajoritarian objection, and points out the metamorphic character of some of the positions in the debate. In that countermajoritarianism refuted from a majoritarian viewpoint stands right behind the very idea of constitutionalism, a distinct refuge at once of the majoritarian positions. And the positions that resist the idea of a timid, majoritarian, judiciary appear to be equally paradoxical, for these positions are simply for being ill at ease with the constitutional principle that is countermajoritarianism par excellence. The discussion then focuses on the Dworkin-Fish debate on the politics of interpretation and at once attempts to pin down some of the veins in Dworkin's thinking on the subject of judicial licence. An overall evaluation of the conceptual scheme, potentialities, and assumptions of legal realism is attempted in chapter 2.4. Realism appears to emphasize the part of the interpreter, as opposed to the text, in the event of adjudication, and question the traditional assumptions of formalism whose mechanistic concept of jurisprudence equates the law with its text. While some of the most crucial of the realist objections to the formalistic concept of adjudication have been genuine and insightful.

 What is truth?	 Virdi, Arhat Singh	 London School of Economics and Political Science (University of London)	 London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)	2010	 I defend the correspondence theory of truth, according to which a statement’s truth consists in a relation of correspondence with extralinguistic fact. There are well-known objections to this view, which I consider and rebut, and also important rival accounts, principal among which are so-called deflationist theories and epistemic theories. Epistemic theories relate the concept of truth to our state of knowledge, but fail, I argue, to respect the crucial distinction between a criterion of truth and the meaning of truth: the view that one cannot do semantics, or metaphysics, without addressing epistemic issues is rejected by this work. Against epistemic theories, I illustrate how truth is independent of epistemic considerations. Deflationism is the more popular of the rival accounts and has gained considerable momentum over the past two decades. It is therefore dealt with in greater detail by this work. Deflationist theories exploit the paradigmatic ‘“Snow is white” is true iff snow is white’ biconditional to argue for an insubstantialist account, according to which truth is conservative with respect to non-semantical facts. On this view, truth’s raison d’être is merely to perform the useful expressive function of generalising over possibly infinite sets of assertions. Against deflationist theories, I claim that the work done by Jeffrey Ketland and Stewart Shapiro conclusively demonstrates how truth is informationally additive over non-semantic facts, while deflationism itself is also an excessively impoverishing theory, inadequate to the tasks it purports to accomplish. This work also defends the thesis that Alfred Tarski’s well-known theory of truth is an authentic correspondence theory. To say this is to say that the clauses of a Tarskian truth-definition can be interpreted in terms of a relation of correspondence that holds between true sentences and the states of affairs they describe. I provide a precise account of what the correspondence in question consists in, claiming that true sentences are homomorphic images of facts, i.e. a true sentence represents, in a form-preserving manner, the truth-making facts in it. This gives precise expression to Wittgenstein’s thesis that true sentences picture the world.	 Thesis or dissertation	 B Philosophy (General)	550185	1
 Perfect and imperfect rights, duties and obligations : from Hugo Grotius to Immanuel Kant	 Salam, Abdallah	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2014	 In this doctoral thesis, Kant's distinction between perfect and imperfect duties is examined. The thesis begins with an exploration of how the distinction originates and evolves in the writings of three of Kant's most prominent natural law predecessors: Hugo Grotius, Samuel von Pufendorf, and Christian Wolff. The thesis then moves on to Kant's own writings. It is argued that Kant draws the perfect-imperfect distinction in as many as twelve different ways, that these ways are not entirely consistent with one another, and that many of them, even taken by themselves, do not hold up to scrutiny. Furthermore, it is argued that Kant's claim that perfect duties always trump imperfect duties - which can be referred to as "the priority claim" - is not actually supported by any one of the ways in which Kant draws the perfect-imperfect distinction. After this critical reading of Kant's writings, the thesis then switches gears and a more "positive" project is attempted. It is argued that the perfect-imperfect distinction, even though it does not support the priority claim, is not altogether normatively neutral or uninteresting. In particular, for some of the ways in which the distinction is drawn, it is shown that the distinction yields the following normative implication: Sometimes perfect duties override imperfect duties and all other times there is no priority one way or the other. Finally, it is explained that this normative implication - which can be referred to as the "privilege claim" - translates into the following practical directive: When there is a conflict between a perfect duty and an imperfect duty, sometimes one must act in conformity with the former duty and all other times one is free to choose which of the two duties to act in conformity with. This practical directive represents the ultimate finding of this thesis.

 Nietzsche's philosophy of overcoming and the practice of truth	 Mitcheson, Katrina Maud	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	2009	 My thesis explored the conceptual and evaluative reasons behind Nietzsche's critique of truth. I narrated the changing relation between our will to truth and the problem of nihilism. I argued that Nietzsche understands truth in terms of a practice which affects its practitioners. To explicate the practice of truth which Nietzsche advocates I explored its continuities, and crucial points of opposition, with a Platonic practice of truth. I claimed that cultivating new habits in how we pursue truth allows the nihilistic form of the will to truth that Nietzsche criticises to be overcome. I offered a reading of the will to power as an interpretation that is both employed in and justified by Nietzsche's practice of truth. In the context of Nietzsche's interpretation that the world is will to power a new practice of truth is potentially transformative. Given Nietzsche's interpretation that the human is made up of various wills to power, which include drives, practices, and habits, a cultivation of new practices and habits can bring about the overcoming of modern man demanded by Nietzsche's critical philosophy. I argued that this process of overcoming through the practice of truth is instantiated in the potential free spirit's gradual emancipation from the Ascetic Ideal. Those with sufficient strength to follow their intellectual conscience will experience a deepening of nihilism that is potentially liberating. These emancipated spirits have the space to experiment in order to find their own values and overcome the nihilism of the Ascetic Ideal. The possibility of such transformation can be seen to connect the distant goal of the Übermensch with human possibility and allow it to serve as the "sense of the earth".

 The experiential world	 Davnall, Richard	 University of Liverpool	 University of Liverpool	2013	 There are four positions one might take in respect of the ontological status of the physical world: physicalism, which says that the physical world is ontologically fundamental, and nothing else is; substance dualism, which says that the physical world is ontologically fundamental, but so is the human mental realm, and that these are in some strong metaphysical sense separate; idealism, which says that the physical world is constitutively sustained, at least in part, by facts about the human mental realm; and a rough collection of views I term 'compatibilism', which holds that both the physical and the mental are fundamental, but that they are not separate as in substance dualism. Of these positions, I argue mainly against the first and last. I begin by demonstrating that all forms of compatibilism are committed to a radically revisionary definition of 'mental' and 'physical', since in ordinary usage, and for good reason, the terms are taken as mutually exclusive. I formulate a definition of 'mental' according to which it means 'subjective, non-spatial, and non-quantifiable', and demonstrate that these properties are necessarily coextensive. Against physicalism, I consider a range of arguments which purport to show that physical space, as a necessary feature of the physical world, cannot be ontologically fundamental, concluding that physical space, or at least the physical space that we are interested in, must be the one which we inhabit, and that our relationship of inhabitancy of this physical space plays a constitutive role in it. Since this assumes that physical space must be in some way constituted rather than fundamental, I finish by refuting a set of strategies which attempt to show that physical space itself must be constituted.

 Time in the philosophy of Gabriel Marcel	 Tattam, Helen	 University of Nottingham	 University of Nottingham	2011	This thesis aims to determine what is distinctive to the philosophy of Gabriel Marcel (1889-1973). While his work has largely been received as a form of 'Christian existentialism' (notably by Jean-Paul Sartre), and thus interpreted in relation to other philosophies of existence, it is my contention that this prevents an appreciation of his specificity. I therefore recommend a new reading of his thought, which, through analysis of his various philosophical presentations of time, re-situates him within the twentieth-century French intellectual tradition. Part I of the thesis provides an introduction to his philosophy of time, analysing his position in specific relation to Henri Bergson (1859-1941). Chapter One raises the question as to whether his position is then compromised by his engagement with eternity, for this seems to undermine time's significance. However, what begins to emerge from Chapter Two onward, is that such a question may be inappropriate with respect to Marcel's understanding of philosophy. Part II (Chapters Three and Four) then explores the implications that his work’s various modes have on the content of his arguments: first, the diary-form of his formative works and his (continuing) use of a first-person narrative style in his essays and lectures; and second, the (non-narrative) form of his theatre, to which Marcel also accorded philosophical significance. Here, Marcel is read alongside Paul Ricœur (1913-2005) and Emmanuel Lévinas (1906-1995), who also tried to approach philosophy differently – as is especially manifest in their conceptions of time. Finally, Part III (Chapter Five) reconsiders the relation between Marcel’s philosophy and religion, asking how his references to God affect the basis of his philosophy, and what this entails for interpreting time in his work. In light of these discussions, the conclusion then reflects on what philosophy is for Marcel, and how he should therefore be received.	 Thesis or dissertation	 B Philosophy (General)	541466	1

 The enigma of the inversion : a study in the dialectics of Hegel and Marx	 Horn, Alan James	 University of Glasgow	 University of Glasgow	2003	The thesis is a contribution to the understanding of the relationship of the dialectical thought and method of G. W. F. Hegel and K. Marx. The aim of the thesis is to ascertain what the relation and the difference between the contrary forms, of the idealist and the materialist dialectic, actually is. The thesis consequently attempts to make sense of Marx’s view that his application of the dialectical method was not only different from but also the “direct opposite” of his idealist predecessor. This theme, itself the source for the enigmatic nature of the inversion, is developed by ascertaining some of the core elements that lie behind and underpin Marx’s own comment; that the rational kernel of Hegel’s mystical form of dialectic could be discovered if it was “turned right side up again”. The thesis also explored the relationship between the early Marx’s critique of Hegel, contained in the 1844 Paris Manuscripts, with the later Marx’s comments on his view of the relation of his dialectic to Hegel’s. As such, the thesis argues that there is both a continuity and a development in Marx’s critical attitude to Hegel’s dialectical thought. The core elements of the rational kernel of Hegel’s dialectic for Marx lies, as the thesis will argue, in the Hegelian account of the general form of working of the dialectic, and in Hegel’s explication of the laws of dialectics. The thesis thus explore the intimate relation of these two interconnected themes from the point of view of Hegel’s systematic idealism, and in Marx’s materialist application of these rational elements to his critique of political economy. This involves endeavouring to elucidate, both the nature of a dialectical account of contradiction, and the related explanation of nomological activity or law from a dialectical perspective. The thesis also attempts to explore the fundamental contrast of the materialist from the idealist elucidation of these core elements.

 Christ for us : a comparative study of the themes of representation and substitution in the theologies of Dorothee Sole, John Macquarrie and Karl Barth	 Graham, Jeannine Michele	 University of Aberdeen	 University of Aberdeen	1993	Christ for us describes the essence of the reconciling act initiated and brought to fruition by the Triune God towards God's errant creation. The themes of representation and substitution have figured prominently in attempts to articulate the nature of this divine act of reconciliation in Christ. The intent of this study is not to present a plethora of viewpoints on these themes, arriving at a general survey of the subject, but rather to focus on the theologies of three contemporary theologians---Dorothee Sole, John Macquarrie and Karl Barth---drawing from this select purview a portrait of key issues arising from these themes and the relative adequacy of their particular attempts to address them. Such a study aims to substantiate the following premises: 1. Representation and substitution, far from being mutually exclusive, are complementary concepts which must be held together, each illuminating the other. As such, they express a view of reconciliation which is both cognizant of sin's radically incapacitating effect---necessitating a Substitute who acts in our place apart from human cooperation---and consonant with the inner logic of the incarnation, wherein such substitution ontologically implicates us as those included in Christ's representative existence as Elect Head of humanity. 2. The marriage of representation and substitution presumes a trinitarian view of grace, interpreted not primarily in legal terms but relationally , in the covenantal context of the Triune God's elective resolve to draw humankind within the faithful embrace of His dynamic, self-giving love through becoming the God of, for and with humankind in Christ. 3. The hypostatic union is vital, not only to an understanding of Jesus' Person as both in continuity with humankind and utterly unique, but also in providing the essential bilateral dynamic by which to interpret his atoning mission, i.e., fulfilling the covenant not only from the divine side qua God, but simultaneously embodying the necessary human response---God as man---on our behalf and in our place.

 Michel Foucault : topologies of thought : thinking-otherwise between knowledge, power and self	 Robinson, Keith Alan	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	1995	 If something new has appeared in philosophy and that "this work is as beautiful as those it challenges" we shall see that it all takes place in a new dimension, "which we might call a diagonal dimension, a sort of distribution of points, groups or figures that no longer simply act as an abstract framework but actually exist in space". The spaces that constitute this immanent dimension are topological or as Foucault says - "heterotopological". We shall designate these heterotopologies: Knowledge, Power and Self. Although these sites are irreducible to each other they seep into and 'capture' each other through a series of multiple and complex relations in such a way as to suspect, neutralise or invert the set of relations that they happen to designate, mirror or reflect. If within these sites subjects, objects and concepts disappear it is only in order to 'disperse' or 'distribute' them according to their variable functions and make them reappear again, released of their 'self-evidence', in a new space of immanence. Each heterotopology is capable of juxtaposing within itself and outside of itself, or rather across its folded surfaces, several formed spaces that are not isomorphic or even compatible but are heterogeneous and communicate with or 'encounter' each other through a pure transmission of elements.

 Participatory knowledge : theology as art and science in C.S. Lewis and T.F. Torrance	 Newell, Roger J.	 University of Aberdeen	 University of Aberdeen	1983	 The thesis argues that an intriguing similarity exists between the theological epistemology of C.S. Lewis, a literary critic and lay theologian, and that of T.F. Torrance, a reformed theologian deeply concerned with the epistemological questions of modern science. Their epistemological interaction is brought to bear on several interrelated issues: the theological roots of modern science, the nature of scientific objectivity, the nature of art and the structures of theological rationality, with particular inquiry into the roles of logic, intuition and imagination. I argue that their writings reveal a fundamental agreement on the nature of rationality, which in turn reflects a universal way of knowing in the arts, sciences and theology. This agreement reinforces the validity of each of these fields of knowledge. I call this way of knowing 'participatory knowledge'; it consists of both cognitive and feeling qualities. Its object-centred participation leads us to a realist commitment to a knowledge of objective reality and ontological structures, though not in the sense of a detached, objectivistic knowledge. From this perspective, I explore the 'field-relationship' between science, art and theology and describe an a posteriori approach to natural theology implicit in Lewis and explicit in Torrance. I conclude that the theological claim to know God is like a science in that a real, empirical object is known, and yet is like an art in that a qualitative experience is of the essence of this knowledge - the knowledge of the living God. The intermingling of the art and science paradigms does not exhaust our understanding of theology, but is a promise and pledge of theology's maturity.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	348671	1
 Leibniz's critique of Locke's views concerning the limits and extent of human knowledge	 Odegard, Douglas Andrew	 Royal Holloway, University of London	 University of London	1963	 Knowledge, for Locke, consists in perceiving agreement between ideas, i.e., roughly either (a) the perception of necessary truth, or (b) the perception of certain facts about oneself. He subsequently includes sensitive knowledge concerning objects actually present to the senses. Leibniz holds a less strict position. There can be no knowledge without ideas and, for Locke, there can be no ideas without the appropriate experience. Leibniz, even after heavily qualifying Locke's view, still seems to disagree. Locke distinguishes "identical" from "non-identical" necessary truths and suggests that the former are all trifling. Leibniz holds that all necessary truths are identical but does not argue for the possibility of discovering necessary truth. Locke also suggests that the knowledge of identical necessary truths, and on occasion even of non-identical truths, consists simply in the knowledge of the uses of words. Leibniz rejects such nominalistic tendencies. For Locke, knowledge of existence is confined to that of oneself, God, and objects actually present to the senses. Leibniz holds a more liberal view, appealing to the reasonableness of the claim that there are external objects not actually present to the senses - a reasonableness which Locke recognises. Human knowledge of general truths in science and metaphysics is virtually impossible for Locke because one can perceive very few logical connections. Leibniz again objects on the grounds that Locke is demanding too much for knowledge, but also because he feels there are greater possibilities of knowledge here in Locke's sense - or at least that there is more a priori knowledge possible here than Locke allows. In view of points raised above, Leibniz remains chiefly a rationalist. Locke's case is not so clear. Aside from his position on the origin of ideas, and save for leanings towards empiricism, Locke is in certain respects even more of a rationalist than Leibniz.

Best intentions : contact between German pietists and Anglo-American evangelicals, 1945-1954	 Kennedy, Robert L.	 University of Aberdeen	 University of Aberdeen	1990	'Best Intentions' is a study of the contacts between German pietists and Anglo-American evangelicals in Germany from the period immediately following the end of World War II in 1945 until after the first evangelistic meetings of Billy Graham in summer of 1954. This thesis takes into particular account the German perceptions of the Anglo-American efforts to bring about reform among German conservatives within the German church, German pietism and the free churches. It also attempts to carefully reconstruct the events as they occurred during the period in question. Current research in the German language on the developments in 19th century pietism has been dealt with in greater detail in providng an understanding of the German reactions. German archival sources containing information on the founding of the World Evangelical Fellowship (1946-1951) and the meetings of Billy Graham in Germany (1954) help in providing an understanding of the German reactions to Anglo-American influences during this period. The British and American evangelicals and German pietists who interacted in the year immediately following World War II shared many of the same historical antecedents and religious convictions. Their recent origins are to be found in the British Keswick movements. The study volunteer movements of the late 19th century gave rise to individuals and organizations whose destinies were inseparably linked following the collapse of Germany in 1945 and during the efforts of conservative evangelicals and pietists to find and establish the new raison d'^etréfor their respective movements in the light of the new developments in world evangelicalism, particularly the rise of the World Council of Churches.

 Science, practice, and justification : the a priori revisited	 Basoukos, Antonios	 University of Exeter	 University of Exeter	2014	 History is descriptive. Epistemology is conceived as normative. It appears, then, that a historical approach to epistemology, like historical epistemology, might not be epistemically normative. In our context here, epistemology is not a systematic theory of knowledge, truth, or justification. In this thesis I approach epistemic justification through the vantage point of practice of science. Practice is about reasoning. Reasoning, conceived as the human propensity to order perceptions, beliefs, memories, etc., in ways that permit us to have understanding, is not only about thinking. Reasoning has to do with our actions, too: In the ordering of reasoning we take into account the desires of ourselves and others. Reasoning has to do with tinkering with stuff, physical or abstract. Practice is primarily about skills. Practices are not mere groping. They have a form. Performing according to a practice is an activity with a lot of plasticity. The skilled performer retains the form of the practice in many different situations. Finally, practices are not static in time. Practices develop. People try new things, some of which may work out, others not. The technology involved in how to go about doing things in a particular practice changes, and the concepts concerning understanding what one is doing also may change. This is the point where history enters the picture. In this thesis I explore the interactions between history, reasoning, and skills from the viewpoint of a particular type of epistemic justification: a priori justification. An a priori justified proposition is a proposition which is evident independent of experience. Such propositions are self-evident. We will make sense of a priori justification in a context of regarding science as practice, so that we will be able to demonstrate that the latter accommodates the normative character of science.

 Environmental philosophy in international law : a study of environmental philosophical perspectives in decisions of the International Court of Justice	 Kolloer, Thomas Henry	 University of Birmingham	 University of Birmingham	2017	 This thesis argues that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is in a unique position to advance environmental norms but that it does not. Reasons for this situation are analysed and, ultimately, a biocentric natural law philosophy is presented to address the deficiencies of the Court's environmental protection. To construct this argument the thesis demonstrates that it is not unreasonable to assume that the Court’s decision-making may embody a tacit philosophy. Notions of environmental duty and the traditions of thought they may be based upon are explored to understand this. Changing conceptions of the place of humans in the world and related notions of responsibility are shown to culminate in morally neutral utilitarianism, which removed all that had limited a ruinous environmental regard. Modern environmental philosophical perspectives must be characterised as movements to different extents, away from utilitarian thinking. ICJ case analysis is conducted against these perspectives, where it is found that the Court is inconsistent and hesitant to articulate the content and status of principles of international environmental law. In response, the thesis sketches a biocentric perspective based on natural law. To conclude the thesis considers what it would take for the ICJ to develop a biocentric legal doctrine.

 Iris Murdoch's romantic Platonism	 Milligan, Tony	 University of Glasgow	 University of Glasgow	2005	This account of Iris Murdoch’s moral philosophy takes the form of a critique. It attempts to show the ways in which she falls foul of what she criticises. Murdoch is concerned about the influence of the romantic tradition upon our contemporary (post-war) accounts of morality. She charges contemporaries, such as Sartre and R. M. Hare with having mistakenly extended freedom in ways that make morality seem like a matter of free choice. Against this, her own most rigorous work (The Sovereignty of Good) advances three central claims: (1) an idea of moral perfection (an ideal Good) is built into our ways of thinking and speaking; (2) this idea of Good/perfection is not an unavoidable fiction but a reality principle, it helps to undermine the egocentricity that prevents us from doing justice to the reality of others; (3) this idea of a single, unitary Good pulls us towards Platonic metaphors. (We are like pilgrims, trying to move out of dark egocentricity and into the light of attention to others). My response to this is advanced in the following three parts: Part one sets out Murdoch’s position, complete with an account of the stylistic peculiarities of its exposition. (She believes that value-laden metaphors are unavoidable, and in some cases irreducible). Part Two flags up her similarity to what she attacks. Far from being a moral quietist, Murdoch is deeply critical of our everyday lack of moral ambition. (It is as if we are content to lurk about in the dark). She rejects everyday (‘bourgeois’) contentment in favour of the command ‘be ye therefore perfect’. Having flagged up this shared rejection of everyday contentment, I explore the way that Murdoch’s apparently diffuse charge of ‘romanticism’ is held together by the idea of erotic striving. Such romanticism is the general theoretical correlate of the wrong model of love, romantic love rather than the slow patient love that she wants us to emulate. On this account, avoiding romanticism requires us to meet the following conditions. Firstly, we must direct loving attention towards the contingent reality of persons without puritanically avoiding attention to messy detail. (We should not just ‘tag’ people symbolically, as one of these or one of those.) Secondly, our attention to the other should really be about them, it should not covertly redirect attention to the self. Thirdly, we should not allow our fascinating suffering to obscure the reality of death. (The realisation of our finitude is a crucial aspect of undermining egocentricity). Part Three consists of chapter-pairs which examine the central Murdochian metaphors of fallenness, eros, and the death of the self in an attempt to show that Murdoch falls foul of what she attacks.

 Methods and approaches to theories of philosophical intuitions	 Kuntz, Joseph Robert	 University of Edinburgh	 University of Edinburgh	2012	 This thesis is about the arguments and the methods that can sustain the epistemic support that comes from intuitions regarding hypothetical cases vis-à-vis theories of intuition. In the past twenty years, philosophical intuitions have received new attention, spurred by fashionable experimental philosophy that empirically tests philosophers’ intuition-engendering hypothetical cases with experimental methods. The results purportedly show that intuitions are unreliable, subject to demographic variation, and error-prone. In response, philosophers have presented various theories of philosophical intuition and explanations of how intuitions are situated in the justificatory apparatus of philosophical methodology. Three types of theories prevail in the literature, each a plausible option for the explanatory sustenance of intuitions’ epistemic efficacy. Selfevidence theories depend on the understanding of the intuited proposition. Intellectual seemings theories depend on the content of the intuited proposition. Judgment theories depend on our normal capacities for making judgments. Judgment theories divide further into disposition-to-believe theories and capacity theories. I argue that, beyond objections and unique epistemic burdens that each theory faces regarding the methodologies underpinning their conception and defense, no one theory of intuition can be reasonably accepted over the others. The centrality of intuitions’ use in philosophical methodology and in philosophers’ ways of thinking and reasoning, giving an argument that supports intuitions as conferrers of epistemic status, which does not itself appeal to intuitions, is a precarious endeavor. I consider various methods to avoid engaging question-begging premises and epistemic circularity. However, none are successful when the theory at hand is characteristically a priori and countenances only intuitions that confer epistemic status. In response to the ill-fated caricature of philosophical intuitions epistemic-statusconferrers, I present my own survey evidence concerning philosophers’ conception of intuition-use in philosophical method. Surprisingly, professional philosophers are more inclined to think that intuitions operate in the context of discovery more so than they are inclined to think that intuitions operate in the context of justification. The upshot of these survey results motivates my preferred account philosophical intuitions wherein philosophical intuitions are bifurcated into epistemic (justificatory intuitions) and epistemically-related (intuitions of discovery) roles. In the light of the objections I pose regarding the proper grounding of intuitions, revising the standard conception of philosophical intuitions requires two sorts of moves in the debate. First, one must offer a proviso for sources of justification that do not epistemically depend on intuitions for the ability to confer epistemic status. This allows one to justify a theory of intuition without appeal to intuition or epistemic regress. Second, one must give an explanation for and build on the recognition that intuitions are bifurcated into justificatory and discovery roles. The added clarity of filling out the nature of bifurcation allows for a more accurate characterisation of philosophical intuitions in the methods of philosophy. Furthermore, that intuitions operate in discovery roles offers an explanation for philosophical innovation and progress.

 Bringing play to life and life to play : different lines of enquiry	 Lester, Stuart	 University of Gloucestershire	 University of Gloucestershire	2016	This doctoral submission draws on a range of published material to pursue meandering lines of enquiry into the study of children’s play. At its heart is a claim that playing is quintessentially the process of life going on in an affirmative manner (Lester, 2015a); not merely an outcome or activity but the grounding of life itself, a force productive of creative novelty that precedes its classification. In developing this account, the writings of Gilles Deleuze, including collaborations with Felix Guattari, and contemporary iterations of what might be termed ‘new materialisms’, take centre stage. it is a geo-philosophical quest that seeks to overcome the individualisation of life and its accompanying categorisation of playing as a subordinate state, something that can only be tolerated if it contributes to furthering the progress of a subject. The intention here is to go beyond such value, to re-position playing alongside life itself and by doing so to question the ways in which childhood, adulthood and space are constructed and practised. This it is not merely carried out at a level of abstraction: true to Deleuzian process philosophy this thesis is not concerned with the meaning of play but questions how does it work and how might it be worked differently? In response, it develops an ‘exemplary method’ (Massumi, 2002, p. 17) by drawing on a series of singular examples from playwork practice, everyday life, research projects and more remote sources. These are designed to be generative and bring forth new concepts rather than reducing things to more of the same. Above all it is an ethico-political manoeuvre, a tentative and modest experiment in (re)thinking and thinking anew what constitutes a ‘good life’ and how we might increase capacities to create a more just and equitable world.

 Renderings of the abyss : some changing nineteenth-century literary perceptions of the animal/human divide	 Kan, Tabitha G.	 University of Essex	 University of Essex	2016	 The aim of this thesis is to amalgamate philosophy and history of science with literature to achieve an overview of changing ideas of the animal/human divide during the nineteenth century. Drawing on the ideas of Jacques Derrida, Friedrich Nietzsche, Julia Kristeva and Giorgio Agamben. I consider this divide and its contents, often regarded as an abyss. The study is written like a time line, starting at the beginning of the nineteenth century and finishing at the end. I split the nineteenth century into four time periods centred around the emergence of Darwinian theory, considered by this study to be the single most prolific scientific event to have occurred during the nineteenth century. These time frames are the pre-Darwinian, the early Darwinian, the late Darwinian and the post-Darwinian. The study is split into four chapters which coincide with these time frames, covering four different novels which exemplify contextually relevant ideas of the abyss. These are Frankenstein by Mary Shelley, Moby-Dick by Herman Melville, Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky and The Island of Doctor Moreau by H.G. Wells. During the course of this study I consider various ideas applied by the authors about the abyssal limits and what they consist of. These include considerations on reason, society, morality and spirituality, all ideas used in various different manners to attempt to explain the abyss. From these various deliberations I formulate a conclusion which takes into account the various nuances which would have effected each of the writer’s formulations of the abyss.

 Pascal's scale of values	 Baird, Alexander William Stewart	 Royal Holloway, University of London	 University of London	1964	 Pascal's wonderment at nature's immensity, and his insistence on its underlying continuity, attest its value for him. The description of nature as a coherent system knowable through geometry indicates that it is intelligible; but Pascal's failure to develop this conception, together with his opposition to cosmological speculation, shows that he sets little store by any mathematical view of nature. The idea of nature which predominates in his writings is of a continuously active process. Although geometry does not therefore provide the key to the understanding of nature, it remains for Pascal a valuable instrument in the demonstration and discovery of truth. Assertions as to the superior value of ethics compared with natural science point to a watershed in Pascal's thinking. The 'utility' lacking in science is found in "honnetete"; but the fluctuating estimate of nature as ethical norm makes it impossible to determine what value it has in this respect. Rascal himself conceives of "morale" as rightly dominated by man's 'end', for it is its relation to this 'end' which determines the moral worth of any act. Dualism is the keynote of Pascal's estimate of both natural law and justice; and he considers that pursuit of the general good, which should constitute the basis of society, has been superseded since the Fall by "amour-propre". Peace continues as the supreme political value only so long as it tends to security of property. The Church's superiority over secular institutions derives from the socializing agency of grace, which enables men to live together in the condition of "ordre" which "amour-propre" precludes in secular society. The 'three orders' form the framework of Pascal's scale of values - the different orders represent at once categories of value and orders of being. And the relativism which characterizes Pascal's estimates of value results from treating value as a perspective of the orders.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	703927	1

 The self and social relations	 Whittingham, Matthew	 University of Kent	 University of Kent	2014	The central subject of this thesis is the nature of the self. I argue against an atomistic conception which takes the human self to exist self-sufficiently and prior to social relations, and in favour of a holistic conception which takes the self to be constitutively dependent on social relations. I defend this view against criticisms that a holistic account undermines the need for what I call 'critical distance' between subjects and their communities. This involves answering the charges that such constitutive dependence: 1) removes the possibility for individuals to determine themselves freely apart from the communities in which they engage; and 2) deprives us of an external standard with which to engage critically with those constitutive communities. I argue that the above criticisms are encouraged by reliance on a certain epistemological picture. This picture involves a foundationalist construal of knowledge that ultimately depends on a notion of an immediately given epistemic content that can serve to give us an absolute conception of an objective reality with which we can do away with partial or relative conceptions of ourselves and the world we inhabit. It is this that leads the critic to demand a standard external to communities, which in turn encourages a notion of the self and freedom that can ultimately be grounded apart from the "distortions" of social practice. I directly attack the notion of an immediately given epistemic content through a series of transcendental arguments, showing that the condition of possibility for our forming any conception of ourselves or the world is participation in social forms of life. I further argue that properly human identities are essentially shaped by the self-conceptions these forms of life make available to us. Since freedom can no longer depend on radical detachment, I offer a new account of freedom as a social achievement, based on a notion of rational progress which allows us to develop ourselves and our social world critically, drawing only on those standards available within our practices. With the notion of an immediately given epistemic content undermined, I have shown not only that freedom and rational progress are consistent with a holistic account, but that in fact they depend on such a holistic account.

 Philosophy, ideology and educational theory	 Adams, Ian S.	 Durham University	 Durham University	1987	 This work is concerned with the nature and scope of ideology. It begins with an examination of the relationship between theory and practice in the relatively uncontentious area of education. An analysis of different kinds of educational theory reveals the nature of the most comprehensive form of such theorising to be problematic. It is argued that a solution to this problem depends upon the solution to the wider problem of the nature of political ideology, to which the discussion therefore shifts. Existing theories of political ideology being deemed inadequate, a fresh start is made by showing how this form of theory combines the descriptive and the evaluative in a particular way and with particular logical consequences. These consequences characterise ideology as a peculiar form of ethical understanding, involving a distinctive way of thinking and having a logical structure of its own. However, these characteristics which make ideology distinctive are not inherently political, and the possibility of there being several different forms of ideology is discussed. With these conclusions it becomes possible to return to the problem of comprehensive educational theory and show that it is composed of a number of forms of ideology, some related to political ideology and some not. The work concludes with some reflections upon the extent to which ideology is an inevitable component of all thinking about human affairs.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy of education	377885	1

 Speculative experience and history : Walter Benjamin's Goethean Kantianism	 Charles, Matthew	 Middlesex University	 Middlesex University	2009	 My thesis explicates and defends what I term an implicit Goetheanism present in the philosophy of Walter Benjamin. It begins by examining Benjamin’s early critique of the Kantian and neo-Kantian concept of experience and argues that a Goethean theory of the primal phenomenon provides the phenomenological model for Benjamin’s radical transformation of the neo-Kantian Idea. I analyse the importance of Goethe’s aesthetics of science for Benjamin’s critical development of Early German Romanticism and suggest that Goethe’s tender empiricism provides the intellectual backdrop to Benjamin’s later materialism. The chromatic-linguistic model of experience which informs Benjamin’s earliest writings is shown to develop into a dialectics of refractive expression, one that has import consequences for his concept of history and his unorthodox version of cultural materialism. My final chapter examines the influence of Goethe upon what it argues is Benjamin’s quasi-Jungian criticism of Marxism, defending the importance of Jung’s semiotic critique of Freud’s theory of dream symbolism and its relevance for a materialist interpretation of ideology. The relationship between the Goethean and Jungian concepts of synthesis explains Benjamin’s proximity to a Jungian concept of the unconscious, it is argued, which is justified on the condition that a critique of Jung distinguishes the archaic image from Benjamin’s dialectical image. This is performed in the final chapter through a consideration of the allegorical and the technological in Jung and Benjamin’s differing receptions of Goethe’s Faust. The existential component of Goethe’s speculative concept of experience provides Benjamin with the resources for thinking of a dialectic of historical completion and incompletion, it is concluded, which is necessary for a philosophical informed cultural materialism.

 Derrida's reasoning : a critical assessment	 Amos, David	 University of Sussex	 University of Sussex	1997	 In a series of early essays, Derrida examines theories of language in the philosophical tradition. He finds a persistent privileging of speech at the expense of writing, which he attributes to the conception of meaning as presence, as an ideal object present to inner perception, and of the sign as a transparent unity of signifier and signified. I trace the notion of "presence" to Heidegger's 'destruction of the history of ontology'. Heidegger criticizes the tradition for privileging perception as the only means of access to being. I accept Heidegger's criticisms of the tradition, but offer an argument to show that he is wrong to deny the priority of scientific ontology. Derrida denies three theses in traditional theories of language: (i) Language has a relation to the world (the reference relation). (ii) The intermediaries in this relation are meanings, which are ideal objects present to inner perception. (iii) Complex sentences derive their relation to the world from simple names. By a close analysis of Derrida's arguments, I show that Derrida is correct to reject (ii), but that once that is done, (i) and (iii) can be retained.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	321346	1
 Authority, states and persons : in the search for optimal reconciliation	 Greenfield, Elyashiv	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2011	 The problem of legitimate authority is widely regarded as fundamental to moral and political philosophy. This thesis aims to explain what the problem precisely is, and to offer a practical method for solving it. The starting point is a claim about the phenomenology of the person as an inherently authoritative agent: we are persons, as distinct from mere ‘things’, by virtue of the authority we possess over ourselves. This claim explains, I argue, why there is a problem of legitimate authority – why the exercise of state authority stands in need of justification – and what the problem precisely is: given the inherent tension between the authority of the state on the one hand, and the self-governing authority of persons on the other, the problem of legitimate authority is essentially that of creating the conditions for optimal reconciliation between them. The bulk of the thesis is devoted to a search for a solution to this problem. The ideal solution lies in developing a concept which I call the Authorization Principle. In its most basic form, the principle states that the exercise of state authority is legitimate only when it is exercised to enforce arrangements that all citizens authorize the state to enforce. The conclusion of the thesis is that the principle should be formulated as follows: The exercise of state authority is legitimate insofar as it is exercised within the provisions of a constitutional arrangement constructed through a process that gives equal weight to all the epistemically undefeated concerns in the society regarding the conditions necessary for persons to exercise personal authority. The solution proposed in the thesis for the problem of legitimate authority has three important implications. The first is that it is entirely within the capacity of ordinary democratic societies to solve the problem. The second is that there is no single legitimate way to govern a society. Standards for the legitimate use of state authority are in some way indexed to culture, ability and resources as well as to other aspects of a society’s unique circumstances. The third is that a society cannot settle the problem of legitimate authority once and for all. The state’s arrangement will require revision every so often in order to maintain the legitimacy of state authority.

 Can the basic principles of rationality be defended rationally?	 Cintora Gomez, Armando	 London School of Economics and Political Science (University of London)	 London School of Economics and Political Science	2002	 It is argued that if theories of rationality are to avoid logical difficulties (i.e., self referential inconsistencies or logical paradoxes), then these theories require a minimal dogmatism, that is, some basic presuppositions that are unjustifiable without intuitions, vicious circularity, or infinite regress. Thus, it is argued that if rationality is characterized as the search for justifications then a comprehensive rationality is in the end an impossible and self -contradictory task; while if rationality is characterized by the criticizability of any position, then a rationality that intends to be comprehensive leads to self-referential logical paradox. It is also argued that there are logical limits to the justifiability of the most basic scientific methodological rules and aims, that is, it is argued that to justify our various scientific methods and aims we are required to assume without a bona fide justification (i.e., dogmatically) some basic cognitive methods and goals. These conclusions are illustrated by exploring the theories of rationality of the Popperian tradition and the theories of scientific method of various naturalised scientific meta-methodologies, in particular, by critically examining the alleged justification of our scientific methods provided by 'evolutionary epistemology' and Laudan's normative naturalism.

 Nietzsche's substantive ethics : towards a new table of values	 Kim, Hyosup	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	2009	 My thesis focuses on Nietzsche’s ethics. More precisely, its main objective is to explore Nietzsche’s substantive ethical framework in a comprehensive, detailed, and systematic manner. Furthermore, the thesis also attempts to examine the epistemological, non-ethical ground of the Nietzschean substantive ethics. Also, it deals with Nietzsche’s critique of conventional morality, and explains Nietzsche’s criticism of morality in terms of his substantive ethics. The central argument of the thesis is, very briefly, that Nietzsche’s philosophy as a whole does have a distinctive, substantive ethical system. Its constitutive elements or contents, being coherently related, are rich, complicated, and concrete. The major category Nietzsche employs in his ethics is the notion of ‘value’ understood as merit or desirability; he is not much concerned with the right or obligatory. Nietzsche views some human qualities, abilities and states and a style of life as noble and desirable for us. Specifically, the creative way of life, creative capacity, self-discipline, the capacity for ‘self-commanding’, knowledge, health, strong affectivity, and vitality constitute the core of Nietzsche’s evaluative standard. Moreover, a variety of dispositions, such as honesty, solitude, courage, and magnanimity, position themselves within his theory of value and are posited as crucial virtues. Finally, my thesis aims at analysing these particular contents of Nietzsche’s substantive ethical system and to examine how the system as a whole works. As such, the thesis is fundamentally an exposition based upon Nietzsche’s own texts, especially, his later works including Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Beyond Good and Evil, The Genealogy of Morals, Twilight of the Idols, and The Antichrist.

 Probability, frequency and evidence	 Benenson, Frederick C.	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	1976	 Chapter I of this thesis considers the frequency theory of probability and in particular its treatmant of individual events. Attempts by frequentists to give an account of ordinary statements of probability which are generally about individual events are criticized at length: Reichenbach's attempts to deal with the problem of individual events is found to be unsatisfactory in virtue of his introduction of such dubious entities a 'fictitious probabilities'; Salmon's related suggestion to treat tha problem of the single case in terms of 'weights' determined by an 'application' of his theory of probability is also found to be unsatisfactory, for the concept of probability defined by his theory can not, on his own admission, be applied to the single case. Proposals by Keynes and Popper to treat the single case along frequentist lines, while apparently more promising, turn out in the end to be too rudimentary and sketchy to fulfill even the minimal condition for an adequate semantic definition of probability - the specification of a probability function which provides an interpretation of the axioms of probability. The basic difficulty for a frequentist in assigning probabilities to individual events is (not surprisingly) found in Chapter I to be that the probability of an individual event will vary depending on what reference class is chosen to determine its probability. In Chapter II however, the dependence of the probability of individual events on the reference class chosen is seen not to present a genuine difficulty in formulating an adequate semantic definition of probability. The variability of the probabilities assigned to individual events indicates that they are relational probabilities crucially involving a reference class in one term of the relation; once recognized the relational character of the probability of individual events provides the basis of an adequate semantic interpretation of the standard axioms of probability. It is shown that the resulting theory of probability can meet the objections raised by Salmon, Von Mises and Reichenbach against the assignment of probabilities to individual events and, indeed, this theory of probability resolves contradictions found to be inherent in Reichenbach and Salmon's treatment of the single case. Chapter III begins with a discussion of a methodological principle by which the relational theory given in Chapter II can be applied to actual situations to determine tbe unique probability values often needed for the purposes of action. This is the well-known principle of choosing the narrowest reference class for which statistics are available. This principle, usually referred to in the thesis as that of choosing the narrowest available reference class, is given a preliminary (and traditional) formulation at the start of Chapter III. Von Mises' requirement of randomness is then analyzed in light of this principle and it is found that if we employ this principle to determine unique probabilities, only random classes of events can be used to assign unique probabilities to every individual member of the class. This is found to account for the view - expressed in Van Mises' requirement of randomness - that only random classes are truly probabilistic. In Chapter IV various problems concerning the principle of choosing the narrowest available reference class are considered. Some of these are familiar, e.g. Ayer's objection to frequentists' use of this principle, the difficulties caused by unlawlike predicates, and the problems raised by the quite common absence of complete statistical knowledge. Less familiar problems are also considered. In particular Chapter IV is concerned with the question of precisely what kinds of reference classes can be considered 'available' for determining the probability of individual events. A solution to this problem is devised, based, in the first instance, on the concept of an effectively calculable function introduced by Church into discussions of randomness. A reference class is said to be available for determining the probability of an individual event if and only if there exists a determinate procedure which, if carried out, would yield the result that the event belongs to that reference class. In the case of reference classes formed by mathematical roles of selection, the existence of a determinate procedure leading to a result is equated with the existence of a recursive function leading to that result. In the case of reference classes based on empirical predicates, the class of determinate procedures is the totality of experimental procedures extant in the scientific field in question. This line of argument is extended to explicate the concept of 'available evidence', which figures prominently in many theories of probability. Various objections to this explication of available evidence are considered and a more refined analysis eventually emerges. Chapter V considers Carnap's thesis that there exist two distinct concepts of probability and it is shown that this conclusion can be avoided by adopting the frequency theory for the singe case given in Chapter II in place of the standard frequency theory - the definition of probability expressed in our theory is shown to be an instance of the definition of probability as a quantitative relation between evidence and hypothesis and thus to have distinct affinities to Carnap's theory of probability. Chapter V concludes with a discussion of subjectivism in theories which make probability a relation between evidence and hypothesis and it is shown how both our theory of probability and the logical relation theory avoid such subjectivism. Chapter VI and VII are concerned with the principle of indifference. Chapter VI begins with a survey of a variety of opinions on the principle and then presents a new interpretation of it as a rudimentary form of semantic definition of probability. It is shown that the principle, in stating conditions under which alternatives are equally probable, actually fixes identity conditions for the concept of probability and, as widely understood since Frege, any statement which fixes identity conditions for a concept fixes a particular sense for that concept, a particular semantics. The definition of probability encapsulated in the principle is that of probability as a comparative relation of evidential support. It is further explained how such a comparative conception of probability will have led to the numerical assignments of probability traditionally arrived at by use of the principle of indifference - when, as was the case with the principle's usual employment, a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive hypothses are (comparatively) judged to be equally likely, it follows directly from the axioms of probability that each hypothesis has the numerical probability 	 Thesis or dissertation	 Probabilities ; Relation (Philosophy)	449514	1

 Evolvability : a formal approach	 Gallagher, Alexis	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2009	 This dissertation clarifies the concept of evolvability, the increased capacity of some organisms or systems to support evolution, especially the evolution of life-like complexity. I survey the literature, which is spread over the fields of population genetics, developmental biology, artificial life, and microbial and molecular evolution. Finding that researchers have often used the term vaguely and incompatibly I identify five distinct kinds or senses of evolvability. I also identify five key constituent ideas, which I discuss in the context of organismic evolvability, a sense of evolvability with deep roots in the traditional fields of animal development and macroevolution. In these fields research into evolvability has historically been hampered by an insuﬃciently detailed knowledge of development. Research in molecular evolution has produced a thorough knowledge of the folding of RNA into secondary structure, which can be regarded as a model of development. This has motivated new approaches to evolvability based on representing development via a single genotype-phenotype mapping function. I build on these approaches to invent new mathematical methods to formalise the traditional ideas. I create an exact model illustrating a classic example of evolvability, the capacity for repeated segmentation and simple modularity. I analyse this with two new formal approaches. First is the genospace algebra, a propositional calculus based on graph theory. It is a formal language for describing genotype-phenotype maps. It provides a system for making calculations, proofs, and diagrams about mutational structures in genotype space, and it is ﬂexible enough to allow description at arbitrary degrees of resolution. Second is a pair of concepts, the genetic leverage and the genetic fulcrum. The leverage provides a crude numerical measure of evolvability, and the fulcrum provides a heuristic for identifying the genomic and developmental causes of evolvability. Besides its specific relevance to diversification and development, evolvability is also crucial to the fundamental question of how evolution produces ordinary biological life. Simulation systems that implement only a conventional textbook model of evolution -– systems possessing only variation, inheritance, and selection –- fail to evolve anything resembling the complexity of the biological world. Research into evolvability is our best bet to illuminate the "missing ingredient" for life-like evolution.

 An investigation of Kant's and Wittgenstein's ideas and their relevance for art and design education	 Cannatella, Howard	 UCL Institute of Education (IOE)	 Institute of Education, University of London	1996	 The philosophical approach that I have taken in my thesis, is an attempt to evaluate the importance of Kant's and Wittgenstein's thinking for art and design practice in education. In order to substantiate my central claim that art and design experience needs to be taken seriously in education, I begin by discussing through Kant's and Wittgenstein' s work some of the major theoretical concerns that appear to underpin aesthetic activity, its experience and thus creative involvement. From this analysis and by developing some of these arguments further, in relation to practical problems,• I explore and demonstrate in the final part of my thesis some of the factors which determine and account for art and design learning in education. The arguments that I produce, are an attempt to redefine expression and meaning in art and design education in a more precise and accurate way. In this respect, the essential distinctions that I aim to clarify concern some of the issues that affect and establish art and design understanding. In general, my arguments are a defence against considering art and design experience as indeterminate, subjective and simplistic. It is with this in mind, that I challenge the way art and design experience is often interpreted in education. The point that I stress, is that art and design practice is a complex and sophisticated learning activity. It is my contention that the complexity of understanding which art and design can entail and which I describe in this work, has seldom been explicitly articulated within an art and design educational context. The suggestions that I make in my work, outline certain ideas which have implications for art and design curriculum issues and teaching practice.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	243293	1

 The pragmatic constructions of Deleuze, Guattari and Miles Davis	 Swiboda, Marcel	 University of Leeds	 University of Leeds	2002	 The aim of the following investigation is two-fold. Firstly, the project takes as its focus the growing corpus of secondary literature written on the work of the French philosophers and theorists Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, whose work has generated a great deal of interest in recent years and a proportionate amount of controversy. Much of this controversy can be attributed to simplifications and misunderstandings on the part of commentators who have in some instances neglected to approach Deleuze and Guattari with sufficent rigour and care, resulting in the perpetuation of so many misunderstandings regarding their work. Secondly, the project will seek to redress some of these misunderstandings by recourse to a pragmatic embodiment of Deleuze and Guattari's concepts and ideas through a case-study based on the life and work of the African-American jazz musician Miles Davis. In attempting to provide a new and challenging case as the basis for this investigation, the overriding aim is to assess the pragmatic remit of Deleuze and Guattari's thought, in terms of aesthetics, ethics and politics, whilst remaining sensitive to the potential limitations and dangers of their project.

 The epiphenomenal mind	 Buttars, Simon	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	2003	 The Epiphenomenal Mind is both a deflationary attack on the powers of the human mind and a defence of human subjectivity. It is deflationary because in the thesis I argue that consciousness is an epiphenomenal consequence of events in the brain. It is a defence of human subjectivity because I argue that the mind is sui generis real, irreducible, and largely an endogenous product (i.e. not dependent on society or its resources). Part I is devoted to arguing that the conscious mind is epiphenomenal. Arguing from, the irreducibility of mental states, the causal closure of the physical domain, and the principle of causal explanatory exclusion, I seek to demonstrate that all theories of mental causation necessarily violate one or more of these premises. Contemporary approaches to mental causation come under two broad categories, those that argue that mental events are supervenient on physical events (such as Davidson, Kim and Horgan) and those (like Haskar) who argue that the mind is an emergent property of the brain. Supervenience based theories, I argue, end up reducing mental states in their search for a theory of mental causation and emergence based theories end up violating the principle of the causal closure of the physical. In part II, I explore some of the consequences of epiphenomenalism for social theory. This exploration comes in the context of a defence of human subjectivity against (i.) those sociological imperialists who view the mind and self as a 'gift of society', and (ii.) social situationalists who have abandoned the concept of action and an interest in 'what's in the head' of the actor, in favour of a concept of social action which views behaviour as action only to the extent that it is socially meaningful. The conclusion is that the social sciences should return to an interpretative style (Weberian) methodology.	 Thesis or dissertation	 B Philosophy (General) ; HM Sociology	400095	1

Psalm 68 in ancient, medieval and modern interpretation	 Ortlund, Raymond C.	 University of Aberdeen	 University of Aberdeen	1985	We base our interpretative study of Psalm 68 on the persuasion that the most objective point of departure for Old Testament exegesis is the body of traditional meanings handed down to us through the Hebrew-based ancient versions and through Judaica. Comparative Semitics may, and at times does, serve to supplement and to correct traditional interpretations; but the specific relationship of tradition with the psalm as opposed to the casual relationship of, say, Ugaritic or Arabic meanings with this particular piece of literature give tradition the fundamental role in establishing the meaning of the Hebrew. Accordingly, we devote the first five chapters to the ancient versions, viz., the Greek, Aramaic, Syriac, Latin and Arabic, in an attempt to determine their value for the modem interpretation of the psalm. While none of the versions discloses an authentic interpretation of the psalm as a unified and coherent whole, for that sense seems to have been lost to them, each one does nevertheless contain various meanings which commend themselves to us as authentic. These are specifically noted. In Chapter Six the commentaries of the three giants of medieval Jewish biblical interpretation are examined: Rashi, Ibn Ezra and David Kimchi. It was during this era that Jewish scholars sought to organize and evaluate their traditionally-inherited body of knowledge of the Scriptures. In a search for credible understandings and beliefs they re-assessed the witness of their fathers with the result that they established an important milestone in the history of biblical exegesis. Neither the versions nor the rabbis provide us with complete or perfect knowledge of the psalm, but within their testimony we have the only solid foundation for objective interpretation. We review the high points of the modern study of Psalm 68 by turning to three landmark English versions in Chapters Seven through Nine, viz., the Authorized Version of 1611, the Revised Standard Version of 1952 and the New English Bible of 1970. Each one is examined in its relation to traditional and modern studies. The AV we find to be essentially a rabbinic interpretation of the psalm in English. The RSV, as a product of its times, searches for greater authenticity by going back beyond the rabbis to the ancient versions and comparative Semitic philology. As a result, there is a fullness to the RSV's rendering which commends itself well to our judgement. The NEB reflects a more skeptical view of the value of tradition for authentic understanding. The aim of this version seems to be to re-create the linguistic situation in which the psalm originated, leaping over the centuries of an accumulated tangle of tradition which defaces and obscures the authentic psalm lying in remains within the Hebrew text. The NEB translators approach the psalm as if it were a recently-discovered document without intervening traditions and seek to establish its meanings through the use of what would have been the relevant linguistic sources in the ancient world. Presumably, the subjectivity of such an approach is outweighed in their minds by the extremely low value of traditional interpretations and by their confidence in their own ability to draw accurate comparative philological relations with the Hebrew text. Their rendering of Psalm 68, however, does not vindicate that confidence. Our own interpretative comments on the psalm are dispersed to some extent throughout the paper. Judgements on the meaning of the Hebrew cannot be avoided, nor should they be, in connection with the versions and rabbis. But the bulk of my particular exegetical opinions are subsumed under the chapters on the AV, RSV and NEB. Where I believe from my own study that the English translators have interpreted a point correctly, I indicate this by offering my own defense and exposition of their rendering. The RSV chapter contains a majority of these discussions. Finally, in the Conclusion, I offer my own interpretation of the structure of the psalm and of the course of the poet's thought, adding remarks there which I had not been able to include conveniently within previous chapters. In my opinion Psalm 68 is a hymn of descriptive praise to God for his power and goodness revealed to Israel in her early history up to his establishment on Zion and of confident expectation that the purposes of God will be brought to complete fulfillment with his eventual conquest and rule of the whole world from his sanctuary at Jerusalem. The psalm is designed to encourage Israel's faith in God as her only lord and source of life and to lead her to deeper commitment to and participation in his purposes for history.

 The postmodern debate and the search for emancipation : rationality, the self and politics in the thought of Foucault, Derrida, Rorty and MacIntyre	 Kelly, Alison Julia	 University of Hull	 University of Hull	1996	 The postmodern philosophical project, which aims to undermine the universalistic, metanarrational and transcendental aspects of traditional Western thought and to bring about an awareness of 'otherness' through deconstruction, has been dismissed out of hand by some theorists. This thesis aims to demonstrate the following points: firstly, that the postmodern insights and critique of the Enlightenment project are well founded, that there do not exist any universal or transcendental truths.Secondly, that the attempts of postmodern theorists to derive from these insights any implication for politics, society, or the self, whether of an emancipatory or of a pragmatic nature, are misplaced. The validity of the second point will be supported by a demonstration that there is an inevitable use of a priori truths in the work of the chosen thinkers as well as everyday discourse; and that postmodern theory, highlighted in the specific concerns of the deconstructed 'other', remains very much within the liberal democratic tradition, which can itself be seen as a product of the Enlightenment project.The philosophers Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Richard Rorty, and Alasdair MacIntyre have been chosen for analysis as their work exhibits the most fundamental tensions within the postmodern stance, tensions which need to be delineated and examined for an appraisal of the future of postmodern political philosophy. Each chapter is divided into sections on Rationality, The Self, and Politics and Society, in part to try to simplify and make accessible their often complex and vague theses, but also as an attempt to reflect how their own rationalities, and views of rationality, are developed into political commentary and prescription.

 The fragile state : essays on luminosity, normativity and metaphilosophy	 Srinivasan, Amia Parvathi	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2013	 This dissertation is a set of three essays connected by the common theme of our epistemic fragility: the way in which our knowledge – of our own minds, of whether we are in violation of the epistemic and ethical norms, and of the philosophical truths themselves – is hostage to forces outside our control. The first essay, “Are We Luminous?”, is a recasting and defence of Timothy Williamson’s argument that there are no non-trivial conditions such that we are in a position to know we are in them whenever we are in them. Crucial to seeing why Williamson’s anti-luminosity argument succeeds, pace various critics, is recognising that the issue is largely an empirical one. It is in part because of the kind of creatures we are – specifically, creatures with coarse-grained doxastic dispositions – that nothing of interest, for us, is luminous. In the second essay, “What’s in a Norm?”, I argue that such an Anti-Cartesian view in turn demands that epistemologists and ethicists accept the ubiquity of normative luck, the phenomenon whereby agents fail to do what they ought because of non-culpable ignorance. Those who find such a view intolerable – many epistemic internalists and ethical subjectivists – have the option of cleaving to the Cartesian orthodoxy by endorsing an anti-realist metanormativity. The third essay, “The Archimedean Urge”, is a critical discussion of genealogical scepticism about philosophical judgment, including evolutionary debunking arguments and experimentally-motivated attacks. Although such genealogical scepticism often purports to stand outside philosophy – in the neutral terrains of science or common sense – it tacitly relies on various first-order epistemic judgments. The upshot is two-fold. First, genealogical scepticism risks self-defeat, impugning commitment to its own premises. Second, philosophers have at their disposal epistemological resources to fend off genealogical scepticism: namely, an epistemology that takes seriously the role that luck plays in the acquisition of philosophical knowledge.

 How to commit to an individual : logic, objects and ontology	 Janssen, F. M.	 University of St Andrews	 University of St Andrews	2014	 In this thesis I propose an improved theory of ontological commitment, one which is neutral on epistemology. Although Quine's quantificational criterion of ontological commitment has many advantages over its competitors, like its univocal treatment of being and existence, its clear account of ontological reduction and its capacity to accommodate implicit commitments, I argue that it has a fatal flaw: the inability to account for ontological commitment to individuals. Quine's choice of a first-order language of regimentation without constants is so entwined with his holist epistemology that imputations of existence cannot be made except to objects-qua-F, qua some wholly third-personal description. Commitments of those who believe that minds reach out directly to objects by means of acquaintance or introspection, encoded in language by constants, are ungrammatical in Quine's language. This breakdown of grammaticality, on my view, is an avoidable result of Quine's behaviourism and holist epistemology filtering into his choice of canonical language. I opt for a broader conception of ontological commitments as incurred by formalised theories with one or more semantic categories of categorematic objectual expressions, whose function is to stand for objects. I expand the language of regimentation at least to first-order logic with constants and identity. This preserves the attractive features of Quine's position. It retains its elegant treatment of reduction and implicit ontological commitments, and its capacity to explain away Meinongian confusions, without being beholden to global holism. My canonical language makes room for acquaintance and first-personal methods as sources of ontological commitment. It has the advantage of allowing theories like Quine's, which confine themselves to objects-qua-F, to be regimented as well as non-holist theories whose criteria of ontological commitment are 'to be is to be the referent of a name' or 'to be is to be the value of a constant or variable'.

 How to model macroscopic worlds : towards the philosophy of condensed matter physics	 Yi, Sang Wook	 London School of Economics and Political Science (University of London)	 London School of Economics and Political Science	2001	 Condensed matter physics studies many-body phenomena, the phenomena involving a huge number of constituents interacting with each other strongly. My theme is modelling in condensed matter physics: the construction of mathematical/physical structures in order to understand many-body phenomena in the world. I study how condensed matter physicists learn about many-body phenomena from the successful employment of models. My proposal is to construe condensed matter physics as engaged essentially with the three activities: model-building, model-exploring and model-based understanding. General theories such as statistical mechanics guide the process of model-building as model-building methodology. I discuss the multiple layers of interactions among general theories (particularly among thermodynamics and statistical mechanics) and show that complementation and cooperation rather than reduction are better concepts for understanding their relation. In model-exploring stage, we probe a model in order to determine what exactly the model implies in itself and what it could with additional constraints. I investigate a number of epistemic roles of approximations in this stage. I also discuss what consists of model-based understanding. With the help of appropriate interpretative models, an well-understood model can provide us with our best representation of the phenomena (substantial theories). Finally, I investigate how physicists successfully deal with some crucial features of critical phenomena using renormalization group methods. I compare the renormalization group methods of condensed matter physics with those of quantum field theory, and argue. I claim that the mean field methods and renormalization group methods in condensed matter physics complement to each other.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	367516	1
 Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari : ontology and the question of living well	 Roberts, Marc Warren	 Staffordshire University	 Staffordshire University	2010	 This aim of this study is to investigate the manner in which Deleuze’s individual and collaborative work can be productively understood as being concerned with the question of living well, where it will be suggested that living well necessitates that we not only become aware of, but that we also explore, the forever renewed present possibilities for living otherwise that each moment brings. In particular, this study will make an original contribution to existing Deleuzian studies by arguing that what legitimises this conception of living well, and what can motivate us to engage in such a practice, is that a life that becomes aware of and explores the open field of present possibilities for living otherwise that each moment engenders is a life that reflects, or that is lived in accordance with, the challenging ontological account that can be discerned throughout Deleuze’s individual and collaborative work; a life lived in accordance with his open, dynamic and thoroughly temporal theory of Being or what I will suggest he came to refer to simply as ‘Life’. In addition, I will argue that in so far as each individual human being is to be understood as an ongoing and immanent expression of Life, an immediate expression of Life understood as a universal, impersonal and pre-individual dynamism, then a life that strives to explore the forever renewed present possibilities for living otherwise that each moment brings - a practice that I shall propose also necessitates that each individual strives to resist the diverse ways in which their present possibilities are continually hindered, thwarted and negated - is not only a life that strives to live in accordance with the temporal dynamism of Life, but is also a life lived in accordance with our own dynamic and thoroughly temporal being.

 Language, ideology and education	 Frowe, Ian	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	1999	 This thesis examines the relationship between language and social reality. The position argued for is one which sees language as having a constitutive role to play in the formation and maintenance of the social world. It elaborates and develops a view expressed by Quentin Skinner, namely, that language and the social world are mutually supportive and exist in a state of dynamic interaction. Because language has this constitutive role in relation to the social world attention to the use of language is important for the language we employ will be a significant factor in determining the nature of that world. The notion of ideology is defined in a critical sense as 'malign decontestation', i. e., the presentation of that which is contestable as if there were only one legitimate perspective. The concepts of absolutism and universalisation are taken as key ideological markers. Given the constitutive role of language, the identification of ideological language becomes important because aspects of the social world which are informed by such a language will reflect the errors inherent in the linguistic structures themselves. One of the central arguments of the thesis is that ideological language often arises when insufficient attention is paid to the ontological differences between activities whose subject matter is the natural world and those whose subject matter is the social world. There is a focus on educational issues because the impetus for this thesis arose out of a growing unease with the nature of the language used in relation to this topic. Although a concern with the language of education is not uncommon, the full significance of the language we use in this area is often unacknowledged because the necessary theoretical background is absent. It is the main purpose of this thesis to provide a philosophical justification for this concern.	 Thesis or dissertation	 B Philosophy (General) ; P Philology. Linguistics	340503	1
 Qu'est-ce que la philosophie africaine?	 Lindon, Edward	 University of Nottingham	 University of Nottingham	2003	 This thesis traces the evolution of the concept of African philosophy through three phases: the cultural essentialism of Léopold Senghor, founder of Négritude, the universalist critical reaction of Paulin Hountondji and the professional philosophers, and the sophisticated particularism of Valentin Mudimbé. The three stages are contextualized with discussion of the socio-political positioning of each writer, his motives, and his particular understanding of what is at stake in the definition of African philosophy. The initial need to bring about a revalorization of African culture and a recognition of African philosophical capabilities is met by a flamboyant and highly vocal cultural movement, Négritude, which is, however, intrinsically limited in scope and lifespan, and sets up a number of persistent, dogmatic suppositions about the ‘essentially African reason’. A demonstration of the Western origins of this essentialism debunks but does not dispel its influence, since it is firmly anchored to the themes of authenticity, colonial influence, and postcolonial independence. This leads to a dilemma where any move to separate African philosophy from the notion of a distinctly African reason is perceived as a Eurocentric attempt at acculturation, or a capitulation to the false universalism of ‘Enlightenment philosophy’, and on the other hand, the view that African thought is essentially different from European thought is also criticized as deriving from the Western colonial discourse. There is no definitive answer to this problem, and even the search for such an answer is itself part of the problem, a further twist in the ruse that Mudimbé believes is inherent to the colonial discourse. The practical solution Mudimbé proposes is to introduce an écart between African scientific practice and the West, to create a new space within which Africans might investigate the field of their experience in an Afrocentric way which will preserve their cultural specificity.

 Alasdair MacIntyre, George Lindbeck and the nature of tradition	 Trenery, David	 University of Nottingham	 University of Nottingham	2014	 This thesis considers the question of justification of belief in a comprehensive metaphysical system, through an exposition and evaluation of the philosophy of Alasdair MacIntyre. It defines a comprehensive metaphysical system as a set of ontological and ethical presuppositions which are taken to encompass and explain the nature of the universe, and which provide a framework for human practical reasoning and action. The thesis argues that such a system is primarily a way of interpreting the world and the place of humanity within it, rather than a speculative theory. It considers the extent to which the notion of justification can be applied to such comprehensive systems, drawing on MacIntyre’s account of tradition-constituted rationality (TCR) and George Lindbeck’s account of religion as a cultural-linguistic system. It outlines the development of MacIntyre’s Aristotelian ethics and argues that the further development of that position in Dependent Rational Animals should be given a central role in the interpretation of his mature philosophy. The thesis illuminates the concept of TCR by applying Lindbeck’s rule theory of doctrine to the question of the identity of different traditions. The account of tradition that emerges from this exercise provides greater specificity to the concept of epistemological crisis, which is central to MacIntyre’s account of the superiority or inferiority of rival traditions. The account of superiority that emerges by linking MacIntyre and Lindbeck’s work provides a retrospective measure of the extent to which one tradition can be held to be (provisionally) justified or (absolutely) unjustified as a comprehensive metaphysical system, and provides a rebuttal to the claim that MacIntyre’s position is relativist. I argue that while Lindbeck’s original account of the nature of religion as a cultural-linguistic system is vulnerable to the charge of relativism, it can be strengthened against this claim by the incorporation of a notion of TCR derived from MacIntyre.

 A society of equals : the meaning, justification and implications of our basic moral equality	 Kirby, Nikolas Norman Patrick	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2015	 This is a thesis about our basic moral equality as human beings: its meaning, its justification and its implications for our society. It offers the fundamental principles of how we are obligated to live together in a Society of Equals. Its major conclusions are as follows. First, whilst there is more than one meaning to the claim that 'we are one another's basic moral equals', the most important meaning for political philosophy is that each individual has Equal Authority. More specifically, each individual has fundamental authority over herself, and herself alone. Secondly, the justification of this fundamental authority over ourselves lies in our common limitation: we are all fallible. Further, we are not merely all fallible in the sense that any one of our beliefs could be false, but also in the sense that we have no non-circular way of judging the reliability of any of our beliefs. This aspect of our natural epistemic position justifies our equal, fundamental, practical authority over ourselves alone. Finally, the most important implication of this justification is that each individual's most basic reason for action is to promote not merely her own, but each and every individual's compliance with her fundamental authority over herself. It follows that each individual has decisive reason to constrain her own compliance with her own fundamental authority over herself, where necessary, to allow the equal promotion of someone else's compliance with her fundamental authority over herself. This principle is called 'Equal Respect'. Upon this principle of Equal Respect arises an architectonic System of Right, and correlative duties, that is called Equal Sovereignty. Under this system, our rights and duties with respect to one another are distributed in accordance with a hypothetical auction and insurance scheme to ensure that each individual is truly sovereign over their own equal share of the world.

 Feminism in multicultural societies : an analysis of Dutch multicultural and postsecular developments and their implications for feminist debates	 Midden, Eva	 University of Central Lancashire	 University of Central Lancashire	2010	 It was long assumed that both multiculturalism and feminism are connected to progressive movements and hence have comparable and compatible goals. However, both in academia and in popular media the critique on multiculturalism has grown and is often accompanied with arguments related to gender equality and/or feminism. According to political scientist Susan Moller Okin for example there are fundamental conflicts between our commitment to gender equality and the desire to respect the customs of minority cultures or religions. If we agree that women should not be disadvantaged because of their sex, she argues, we should not accept group rights that permit oppressive practices. Okin’s claims led to a complex and highly important debate both in academia and in public debates. The main aim of this thesis is to explore in depth the different discourses about multiculturalism and feminism and develop a more inclusive and nuanced redefinition of the relationship between multiculturalism and feminism. The focus of the analysis will be on the Netherlands, where the debate has been intense and paradigmatic of similar debates in most countries. The first part of the thesis explores the literature on multiculturalism and feminism, and discusses the importance of for instance intersectionality, the politics of location and situated knowledges for a better understanding of the debates. The second part of the thesis is dedicated to fieldwork. A preliminary media analysis is undertaken to analyse the main aspects of the public debate as they appear in the feminist magazine Opzij. On the basis of this analysis, a series of focus groups with women belonging to organisations that are considered stakeholders in the debate (e.g. feminist, religious, cultural or sub-cultural) is organised. The thesis provides a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationship between the concepts of multiculturalism and feminism. It argues that gender equality is often misused in islamophobic and anti-migration discussions, which also harms the position of minority women. Furthermore, it demonstrates that a more nuanced and inclusive interpretation of multiculturalism and feminism acknowledges the multiple layers of this debate, starts from intersectionality and includes critical accounts of secularism and religion, colonial history and subjectivity.

 Daisaku Ikeda's philosophy of peace : human revolution, dialogue and global civilization	 Urbain, Olivier	 University of Bradford	 University of Bradford	2009	 Daisaku Ikeda is the Buddhist leader of one of the most visible religious movements today, the Soka Gakkai International (SGI). In this thesis, the main research question concerns the peace philosophy of Ikeda and its contribution to peace theory. Daisaku Ikeda and the SGI have been the subject of several scholarly studies in the fields of religious history and sociology. The focus of this research is on the significance of Ikeda's contributions in the field of peace studies, where his work has not yet been the subject of systematic investigation. It is argued that the originality of Ikeda's philosophy of peace resides in two main elements. First, the starting point is consistently human life and its potential for peace and happiness, not the omnipresence of conflict. Second, he offers a coherent system linking the individual, dialogical and global levels, which can be represented as a triangle made of three conceptual frameworks, that of Humanistic Psychology (Human Revolution), Communicative Rationality (Dialogue) and Cosmopolitan Democracy (Global Civilization). It is also argued that while being inspired by Ikeda's Buddhist spirituality and his loyalty to his mentor Josei Toda, this secular humanist approach to peace offers an effective and original way for all people to participate in the construction of a better world, regardless of their religious or ideological affiliation, social background or cultural practices.

The personalism of Denis de Rougemont : spirituality and politics in 1930s Europe	 Hériard Dubreuil, Emmanuelle Therese Irenee	 University of Cambridge	 University of Cambridge	2005	Neither communist, nor fascist, the personalist third way was an original attempt to remedy the malaise of liberal democracies in 1930s Europe. Personalism puts the emphasis on the human person – understood to be an individual 'in relation' to others – as the foundation and aim of society. Yet, because of the impossibility of subjecting the human person to a systematic definition, personalism remains complex and multifaceted, to the extent that it might be best to speak of ‘personalisms’ in the plural. The various personalist movements that emerged in France in the 1930s are little known, and the current historiography in English misrepresents them. This dissertation is a study of the various personalist movements based in France in the 1930s, examining their spiritual research and political philosophy through the vantage point of Swiss writer Denis de Rougemont (1906-1985). In Rougemont lies the key to understanding the personalist groupings because he was the only thinker to remain active in the two foremost movements (Ordre Nouveau and Esprit) throughout the 1930s. The personalism of Ordre Nouveau was the most original, in both senses of the term. It deserves particular attention as an important political philosophy and an attempt to justify political and economic federalism in 1930s Europe. Whilst an Ordre Nouveau activist, Rougemont can be looked upon as the mediator and federator of personalisms in the 1930s. However, Rougemont’s particular contribution to personalist thought was more spiritual and theological than political or economic. Rougemont saw it as his vocation, in a strict religious sense, to oppose ‘totalitarian’ regimes. In the final analysis, Rougemont’s personalism was best expressed in the minor classic 'L’Amour et l’Occident' (1939). Love, as the affirmation of personal freedom and responsibility vis-à-vis other persons, is the closest illustration of what lies at the heart of the personalism of Denis de Rougemont.

 Freedom and fatalism in Wittgenstein's 'Lectures on Freedom of the Will'	 Carter, Alexander David	 University of Essex	 University of Essex	2015	This thesis seeks to demonstrate the continuing relevance of Wittgenstein’s approach to the problem of freedom of the will, primarily as expounded in his “Lectures on Freedom of the Will” (LFW). My overall aim is to show how Wittgenstein works to reconfigure the debates about freedom of the will so that it can be confronted as the kind of problem he thinks it ultimately is: an ethical and existential problem. Not published until 1989, the LFW have received scant critical attention. I argue that Wittgenstein’s approach is highly distinctive in a way that makes it significantly less vulnerable than its closest cousins to certain powerful lines of critical attack. Chapter One brings out the distinctiveness of the LFW, especially vis-à-vis a putatively Wittgensteinian form of compatibilism, exemplified by Kai Nielsen. Albeit in different ways, Wittgenstein and Nielsen are both concerned to show why being caused to act, e.g. by the laws of nature, does not equate to being compelled to act, e.g. against one’s will. Unlike Nielsen, however, Wittgenstein further recognises that showing the compatibility of freedom and natural laws establishes no more than the logical consistency of holding people responsible, given determinism, and so cannot itself constitute a defence of our practices. Chapter Two introduces, as a still closer comparison with Wittgenstein, P. F. Strawson’s practice-based defence of interpersonal, ‘reactive’ attitudes (e.g. feelings of resentment, gratitude, etc.). I argue that the same correlation between a belief in freedom of the will and the primitive expression of ‘reactive’ attitudes/feelings is central also to the LFW. However, I further argue that certain major lines of criticism of Strawson’s practice-based defence of our current practices, familiar in the critical literature, do not in the same way threaten Wittgenstein’s defence of a broader practice-based approach, one that encompasses both reactive and non-reactive attitudes. Chapters Three and Four deal with the difficulties arising from the recognition that our most entrenched and ‘natural’ attitudes are non-reactive rather than reactive, including attitudes that are properly called ‘fatalistic’. Chapter Three develops a response to Galen Strawson’s criticism that if reactive and non-reactive attitudes are both equally expressive of human nature, then any merely descriptive approach to these attitudes will be incapable of resolving the fundamental question of which of these sorts of attitude we ought to adopt. Finally, Chapter Four examines Wittgenstein’s sustained interest in forms of life, especially religious forms of life, which appear to give equal weight to both reactive and non-reactive attitudes.

 A critique of the homogeneous unit principle in light of a practical theology perspective	 Fong, Bruce W.	 University of Aberdeen	 University of Aberdeen	1992	According to McGavran's theory, people "like to become Christians without crossing racial, linguistic and class barriers"; therefore, they should not be forced to do so. Instead, churches are encouraged to grow along racial, linguistic, or class lines. The emphasis is on evangelism but this includes both church planting and church renewal. The HUP theory is presented as a real phenomenon which is characteristic of much church development. Its reality as a natural human dynamic is supported with good anthropological data. The debate that has surrounded this controversial perspective is examined both in its historical and current context. Here the HUP theory with regard to sanctification is found to be inadequate and with regard to addressing the moral responsibility of the church in challenging racism is also inadequate. The "mutual acceptance" philosophy, an alternative for church development and mission is presented. The key Scripture of Ephesians 2 is examined in detail. A balance of both sanctification and moral responsibility is formulated. Ethnic churches will continue to be developed by the natural causes of sociological elements; but, the church at large, however, must pursue its theological responsibility of promoting a church that functions beyond such limitations - Christians must accept each other and express that acceptance in koinonia. Finally, the "mutual acceptance" philosophy is applied both to the church situation and to missions as a Biblically responsible approach to bringing the Gospel to the world. Several models are presented for churches in different situations and circumstances. Real examples of churches making an impact on the problem of racism and need for biblical koinonia beyond the limits of ethnicity are examined and joined with creative suggestions for church development.

 Theology, ontology and the philosophy of art, with special reference to Paul Tillich and the Dutch Neo-Calvinists	 Begbie, Jeremy S.	 University of Aberdeen	 University of Aberdeen	1987	 This thesis examines the relationship between the philosophy of art on the one hand, and Christian theology and ontology on the other. In Part I, Paul Tillich's interpretation of art is presented against the background of the development of his metaphysics and ontology. It is argued that the connection between the two is close and the influence reciprocal. A critical evaluation of Tillich reveals that he fails to provide Christ-centred, non-symbolic, objective criteria of truth in art. In Part II, the Dutch Neo-Calvinist tradition is surveyed with reference to Abraham Kuyper, Herman Bavinck, Klass Schilder, Herman Dooyeweerd, Hans Rookmaaker and Calvin Seerveld. By way of critisism, a dichotomy between creation and redemption is detected, due to an inadequate methodological grasp of the Headship of Christ. There is also a legalistic doctrine of God, a law-dominated doctrine of creation, and an undue emphasis on man's duty and obedience, particularly in culture. Although it is noted that the Neo-Calvinists offer objective Christian criteria of artistic value, their emphasis on beauty as the qualifying characteristic of art is rejected. In Part III, a Christological integration of creation and redemption is developed. From this, a theology of human creativity in general, and artistic creativity in particular, is expounded. Art is defined as a human artefact which functions metaphorically, and some of the theological and philosophical consequences of this are explored.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	377606	1
 Axiomatic studies of truth	 Fujimoto, Kentaro	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2010	 In contemporary formal theory of truth, model-theoretic and non-classical approaches have been dominant. I rather pursue the so-called classical axiomatic approaches toward truth and my dissertation begins by arguing for the classical axiomatic approach and against the others. The classical axiomatic approach inevitably leads to abandonment of the nave conception of truth and revision of the basic principles of truth derived from that nave conception such as the full T-schema. In the absence of the general guiding principles based on that nave conception, we need to conduct tedious but down-to-earth eld works' of various theories of truth by examining and comparing them from various points of view in searching for satisfactory theories of truth. As such attempt, I raise two new criteria for comparison of truth theories, make a proof-theoretic study of them in connection to the foundation of mathematics.

 Resolving inconsistencies in Plato : the problem of Socratic wisdom in the 'Apology' and the 'Charmides'	 Rasmussen, Will Spain	 King's College London (University of London)	 King's College London	2006	 In the Apology Plato ascribes to Socrates a kind of knowledge that distinguishes him from others, viz., the knowledge that in truth he is worthless in respect of knowledge. Furthermore, the cultivation of this ‘Socratic wisdom’ is presented by Plato as necessary for anyone wishing to pursue the examined life, the only life worth living for a human being, and therefore as something that we all should seek to acquire. In the Charmides, however, Socrates argues at length to the conclusion that such knowledge is neither possible nor, even if it were possible, of any use. This apparent contradiction in Platonic doctrine is the problem of Socratic wisdom in the Apology and the Charmides. The thesis first constructs the problem of Socratic wisdom from the text of the two dialogues. It then considers various strategies in the long tradition of Platonic scholarship by which proposals have been made to resolve this and other inconsistencies in Plato. These strategies are assessed and reasons are given for preferring a recent approach called the ‘double dialogue’ reading of Plato, which treats his works not primarily as vehicles for publishing his doctrines, but as philosophical challenges for the reader. The thesis then conducts a double dialogue reading of the second half of the Charmides and demonstrates how this way of reading Plato provides a resolution to the problem of Socratic wisdom. The resolution lies in showing how, in the Charmides, Plato issues a challenge to the reader to address the inadequacies of the model of knowledge that underlies the apparent success of the dialogue’s refutation of Socratic wisdom. Thus, not only is the problem of Socratic wisdom resolved, but the double dialogue strategy of reading Plato is validated for further employment in resolving other inconsistencies in Plato.

 Salvation in a social context : the impact of Hegelian social theory on modern understanding of soteriology, with particular reference to the Phenomenology of Spirit	 Reed, Esther D.	 Durham University	 Durham University	1992	The study is an exercise in interdisciplinary practice. It concerns the relationship between theology and socio-philosophy and considers the type of dialogical theory that is required in order to articulate the meaning of salvation socially. The intention is mediate a theological understanding of salvation through issues raised by Hegel in The Phenomenology of Spirit and which continue as matters of concern to his interpreters. The study is divided into three main /arts, Identity, Alienation and Community. Each part reP1.sents interrelated areas of human experience which bear upon Christian and nonChristian social theory. The Introduction and Part 1 outline difficulties on the side of faith in articulating an idea of God's salvation for the contemporary needs and goals of society. I paint in broad brush strokes the shape of the contention over how to speak about salvation in a social context, in particular, the dualism between talking of 'the social' either terms of the functions of collected individuals or as a single entity. Part 2 introduces critical interpretations of Hegel and his treatment of various social forms of alienation. Relevant contributions from contemporary non-Christian social theorists, Jurgen Habermas, in particular, are summarized and discussed. 1 In Part 3 I consider what is inadequate in Hegel's own superseding of the Christian understanding of community and ask: -What kind of thought is able to sublate Hegel's own inadequate notion of community?- Using analogical reasoning, I suggest that it is possible for theology both to learn from Hegel and his interpreters, and to criticize them. I look at some implications for Christian social theory today.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	334428	1
 Schopenhauer's Spinozism	 Bunker, Jenny	 University of Southampton	 University of Southampton	2015	 This thesis investigates Schopenhauer's Spinozism in relation to the topics of the self and ethics. It aims to show that a recognition of the parallels between the two philosophers is illuminating in terms of understanding and interpreting Schopenhauer’s philosophy. Such a recognition brings to the fore philosophical resources in his system which are otherwise under-exploited, helps to solve interpretive puzzles and provides a new vocabulary with which to more adequately delineate key Schopenhauerian concepts. Chapters one and two address the metaphysics of the self in the philosophies of Schopenhauer and Spinoza, arguing that neither thinker accepts the Cartesian dogma that the self is to be identified with the mind; each insists upon the self’s embodiment and its integration into reality at large. Each, too, offers an explanation of how, in spite of this, individuals can be picked out both physically (within the spatio-temporal realm) and in virtue of their possession of an eternal nature or essence. A comparative analysis of these explanations forms the basis of the second chapter. The thesis then turns to the subject of ethics and salvation. Chapter three shows that their shared determinism bequeaths Schopenhauer and Spinoza a common problem regarding the viability of practical ethics. It demonstrates that Schopenhauer’s philosophy boasts the resources for an ethics along the lines of Spinoza’s and that his rejection of them generates explanatory and metaphysical puzzles for the Schopenhauerian. Both systems culminate in an account of blessedness or salvation. The final chapter proposes that the differences between these accounts are best understood in the light of Schopenhauer’s epistemological and metaphysical pessimism – and again, enumerates some of the challenges that result for an interpreter of his philosophy. The thesis concludes with an indication of further work which could usefully be performed both in terms of interpreting Schopenhauer’s philosophy and of situating it with reference to established philosophical traditions.

 Ends of the Mahābhārata	 Shalom, Naama	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2012	 The assertion that the Mahābhārata (MBh) narrative is innately incapable of achieving a conclusion has attained the status of a disciplinary truism in the epic’s study. My thesis challenges this prevalent assumption by proposing an un-investigated path of inquiry into the philological, historical, literary and semantic aspects of the epic. The thesis discusses the ending of the MBh, the Svargārohaṇa parvan (SĀ) by exploring several trajectories: the study of the SĀ in epic scholarship; its reception in the later tradition in Sanskrit literature; and finally, the problematic aspects of the SĀ and its relation to the rest of the narrative. It first points out that in comparison to other MBh episodes, the SĀ has been received with significant disregard or suppression in the literature commenting on the epic. Second, it characterizes the nature of the suppression of the SĀ in each of the three literary strands commenting on the MBh (epic scholarship, Sanskrit adaptations and theoretical discourses). It argues that all of these considerations, which are external to the MBh, have tended, in various modes, to suppress, ignore or overlook the importance of the SĀ. The thesis then proceeds to argue that on the most significant and internal level of the text itself, the SĀ is intrinsically consistent with the rest of the MBh narrative, and that this makes it thematically integral to the text as a whole. This argument derives from the importance with which this study addresses the moment of the condemnation of dharma in the SĀ, and is furthered by a philological and semantic study, as well as textual analyses of the multiple occurrences of the Sanskrit verb garh throughout the MBh. The use of this verb by the epic protagonist, Yudhiṣṭhira, in condemning his father, Dharma, at the last scenes of the SĀ comprises a key moment that bears significant and myriad implications upon the understanding of this pivotal concept (dharma), to which the entire epic is devoted.

Embodied souls, ensouled bodies : an exercise in christological anthropology and its significance for the mind/body debate, with special reference to Karl Barth's 'Church dogmatics' III/2	 Cortez, Marc	 University of St Andrews	 University of St Andrews	2006	Contemporary developments in cognitive neuroscience are having a profound impact on the philosophy of mind as philosophers work to understand the implications of these advances for appreciating what it means to be a human person. At the same time, a recent consensus has formed among contemporary theologians around the thesis that Jesus Christ is the revelation of what it means to be truly human. Unfortunately, very few thinkers have made any concerted effort to bring these two developments into dialogue with one another. This study addresses this lack by drawing on the anthropological insights of Karl Barth and bringing them to bear on certain aspects of the contemporary discussions regarding the mind/brain relationship. The thesis thus comprises two major sections. The first develops an understanding of Karl Barth’s theological anthropology focusing on three major facets: (1) the centrality of Jesus Christ for any real understanding of human persons; (2) the resources that such a christologically determined view of human nature has for engaging in interdisciplinary discourse; and (3) the ontological implications of this approach for understanding the mind/body relationship. The second part of the study then draws on this theological foundation to consider the implications that understanding human nature christologically has for analyzing and assessing several prominent ways of explaining the mind/body relationship. This study, then, is an exercise in understanding the nature of a christocentric anthropology and its implications for understanding human ontology. While it will devote significant attention to the theology of Karl Barth and various contemporary philosophers of mind, its fundamental aim is to draw together these apparently disparate fields of inquiry by engaging both theology and philosophy in a vital dialogue on the nature of the human person as revealed in the person and work of Jesus Christ.

 For some proposition and so many possible worlds	 Fine, Kit	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	1969	In this thesis, I deal with the notions of a condition holding for some proposition and a proposition being true in a certain number of possible worlds. These notions are called propositional quantifiers and numerical modalizers respectively. In each chapter, I attempt to dispose of a system. A system consists of: a language; axioms and rules of inference; and an interpretation. To dispose of a system is to prove its decidability and its consistency and completeness for the given interpretation. I shall, in passing, make applications to de definability, translatability and other topics. In Chapter 1, I consider the system 5SQ. Its language is that of 55 with Q as a fresh unary operator.

 Experience and practice : gendered knowledge as a challenge to our epistemological paradigm	 Gonzalez Arnal, Stella	 University of Hull	 University of Hull	2000	 Feminist epistemology has two aims: to show the androcentrism present in certain paradigmatic accounts of what counts as good knowledge and to provide us with alternatives. In this thesis I will follow that tradition and I will argue for a new epistemological paradigm that avoids androcentrism and revises our concept of knowledge. I will support a theory grounded in feminist standpoint epistemology, but with influences of feminist empiricism and postmodernism.

 The physicality of the self	 Turp, Maggie	 University of Hertfordshire	 University of Hertfordshire	2003	The submitted publications address aspects of 'The Physicality of the Self from a psychoanalytic perspective and in so doing extend the remit of psychoanalytic thinking. Conscious and unconscious investment of personal meaning in physical exercise, body-oriented behaviour and physical dimensions of experience and communication is explored through presentation and discussion of clinical case examples and infant observation material. The embodied nature of our being is identified as an issue of key significance in psychoanalysis, where unconscious communication, much of which is non-verbal, is a central concern of both theory and practice. Ways of conceptualising psychosomatic disturbance are discussed, whether the disturbance emerges in physical symptoms without apparent organic underlay or in disturbed body-oriented behaviour such as eating disorders and self-injury. With regard to clinical practice, the central significance of receptivity to unconscious communication and capacity for containment (Bion 1962) is reaffirmed. The therapist's 'use of body' as part of the 'use of self Is discussed with particular reference to somatic communication in the transference - countertransference matrix. The primary context for the work is a contemporary object relations framework. The perspective on embodiment or'indwelling' developed by D. W. Winnicott and the post- Kleinian concept of 'psychic skin' are of particular Importance. The disciplines of philosophy, psychology, neuroscience and sociology constitute a secondary, broader, context and inform the discussion of changing perspectives on 'mind', 'body', 'health' and'illness'. A'continuum' model of self-care and self-harm is developed. The acronym 'cashas' is introduced to refer to 'culturally accepted self-harming acts/activities', behaviours which occupy a border area between good enough self-care and clinically relevant self-harm. Drawing on clinical material and research Involving practitioner discussion of clinical vignettes, arguments are advanced for the relevance and clinical usefulness of the 'continuum' model.

 Inventing the market. Smith, Hegel and political theory	 Herzog, Lisa Maria	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2011	 This thesis analyses the constructions of the market in the thought of Adam Smith and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and their relevance for contemporary political philosophy. Combining the history of ideas with systematic analysis, it contrasts Smith’s view of the market as a benevolently designed ‘contrivance of nature’ with Hegel’s view of the market as a ‘relic of the state of nature.’ In two interpretative chapters these two constructions of the market are discussed within the contexts of Smith’s and Hegel’s thought. In three systematic chapters, the relevance of these different constructions for the problems of identity and community, social justice, and different notions and dimensions of freedom is discussed. The first of these chapters argues that the conceptualization of the labour market as a market place for human capital or as a locus for the development of a professional ethos has a deep impact on how one thinks about the relation between individual and community, cutting across the debate between liberals and communitarians. The second systematic chapter shows that the market can be seen either as an instrument for addressing issues of social justice or as an institution against which social justice needs to be realized: for Smith, who thinks that free markets reward virtue and equalize income, it is the former, whereas for Hegel, who holds that free markets lead to unpredictable results and exacerbate social differences, it is the latter. The third systematic chapter addresses the relation between different aspects of liberty and the market. It shows that the market offers both chances and risks for liberty in the sense of individual autonomy, and analyses the relations of the market to positive liberty in a political sense. The concluding chapter draws some broader methodological lessons, arguing for a closer integration of economic and political theory at a ‘less-ideal’ level.

 Pavilioned on nothing : nihilism and its counterforces in the works of Oscar Wilde	 Cavendish-Jones, Colin	 University of St Andrews	 University of St Andrews	2013	 This thesis explores the role of Nihilism in Oscar Wilde's thought and writing, beginning with the depiction of Russian Political Nihilism in Wilde's first play; Vera, or the Nihilists and tracing the engagement with philosophical Nihilism in his fiction, drama and essays, up to and including De Profundis. It is argued that Russian Political Nihilism derives from the same sources and expresses the same concerns as the philosophical Nihilism discussed by Nietzsche in The Will to Power, and that Nietzsche and Wilde, working independently, came to a strikingly similar understanding of Nihilism. Philosophical Nihilism is defined in two ways; as the complete absence of values (Absolute Nihilism) and as a sense that, while absolute values may exist, they are unattainable, unknowable or inexpressible (Relative Nihilism). Wilde uses his writing to express Nihilism while simultaneously seeking aesthetic and ethical counterforces to it, eventually coming to see Art and the life of the Artist as the ultimate forms of resistance to Nihilism. Wilde's philosophical views are examined in the context of his time, and in the light of his exceptionally wide reading. He is compared and contrasted with Nietzsche, the philosopher who has done most to shape our view of what Nihilism means, in his ethical and aesthetic response to Nihilism. The conclusion also considers the reception of Wilde's expression of Nihilism and his employment of Art as the only superior counterforce in the first half of the twentieth century, with particular reference to the works of Gide and Proust. Their engagement with Nihilism is explored both in historical context and as a way of addressing a problem which has become uniquely pervasive and pressing in the modern era.

 Three views of political philosophizing and the idea of state neutrality	 Sofianopoulos, Christos	 London School of Economics and Political Science (University of London)	 London School of Economics and Political Science	1995	 This thesis is an attempt to understand the Neutrality Debate, in the light of two basic distinctions: a distinction between political philosophy and politics, and a distinction between three different views of political philosophizing, which I call foundationalism, explanationism and interpretivism. According to foundationalism, the political philosopher starts with an account of what is essentially human and deduces from it moral/political principles, which should govern every human society. According to explanationism, the political philosopher seeks to understand a particular society (e.g. the Western state) sub specie aeternitatis, i.e. as an immutable, autonomous, self-sufficient world of ideas. Similarly, interpretivism focuses on a particular society (e.g. the Western state), but understands it as an ever-changing world of shared conceptions, understandings and self-perceptions, which are unearthed by the political philosopher. Of the three meta-theories only foundationalism and interpretivism are normative (regulative), whereas explanationism is an intellectual exercise. What is commonly known as "state neutrality" is actually three different philosophical positions each corresponding to a different one of the three meta-theories. Given that each one of these three state neutralities makes different epistemological assumptions, their combination into a single (meta-theoretically mixed) argument with the intention of making state neutrality more attractive to a wider audience is flawed from a philosophical point of view. Such an argument is "political" in that it seeks to persuade rather than to demonstrate philosophical truth.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	338417	1

 Word and object in Lucretius : Epicurean linguistics in theory and practice	 Taylor, Barnaby	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2013	This thesis combines a philosophical interpretation of Epicurean attitudes to language with literary analysis of the language of DRN. Chapters 1-2 describe Epicurean attitudes to diachronic and synchronic linguistic phenomena. In the first chapter I claim that the Epicurean account of the first stage of the development of language involves pre-rational humans acting under a ‘strong’ form of compulsion. The analogies with which Lucretius describes this process were motivated by a structural similarity between the Epicurean accounts of phylogenetic and ontogenetic psychology. Chapter 2 explores the Epicurean account of word use and recognition, central to which are ‘conceptions’. These are attitudes which express propositions; they are not mental images. Προλήψεις, a special class of conception, are self-evidently true basic beliefs about how objects in the world are categorized which, alongside the non-doxastic criteria of perceptions and feelings, play a foundational role in enquiry. Chapter 3 offers a reconstruction of an Epicurean theory of metaphor. Metaphor, for Epicureans, involves the subordination of additional conceptions to words to create secondary meanings. Secondary meanings are to be understood by referring back to primary meanings. Accordingly, Lucretius’ use of metaphor regularly involves the juxtaposition in the text of primary and secondary uses of terms. An account of conceptual metaphor in DRN is given in which the various conceptual domains from which Lucretius draws his metaphorical language are mapped and explored. Chapter 4 presents a new argument against ‘atomological’ readings of Lucretius’ atoms/letters analogies. Lucretian implicit etymologies involve the illustration, via juxtaposition, of language change across time. This is fully in keeping with the Epicurean account of language development. Chapter 5 describes Lucretius’ reflections on and interactions with the Greek language. I suggest that the study of lexical Hellenisms in DRN must be sensitive to the distinction between lexical borrowing and linguistic code-switching. I then give an account of morphological calquing in the poem, presenting it as a significant but overlooked strategy for Lucretian vocabulary-formation.

 The reality of species	 Collier, Rohan	 Royal Holloway, University of London	 University of London	1985	 This thesis examines the nature of biological species, and argues that species are real. The thesis starts with a descriptive account of species drawn from biology. This includes taxonomic views, theories of speciation and theories in ecology. In this chapter a particular definition of species, 'the biospecies', is reached. The thesis continues in Chapter Two with a philosophical account of species, which aims at reaching an understanding of the kind of entities species are. The chapter concludes that species are natural kinds, but not as traditionally construed. Chapter Three looks closely at the use biologists make of species terms, and argues that biological theories are committed to such terms. That species terms cannot be dispensed with in biological statements indicates that species are real. If species are real, they are entities for which questions of identity make sense. Chapter Four reviews different criteria for the individuation and identity of species. All the criteria are found to suffer from problems of vagueness. In view of the difficulty of providing criteria for species identity, the thesis turns in the fifth chapter to two biological views---numerical taxonomy and neo-Darwinism---which claim that biological theories can dispense with species terms. But a look at these reductive theories shows that one loses a certain measure of explanation if species are dispensed with. In the light of the failure of the reductive theories, a fresh attempt is made in Chapter Six at giving a criterion for species sameness. This last chapter also serves as a general conclusion to the thesis.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy Of Science	704697	1
 Psychophysicality : rethinking the physicalist foundations of the mind/body problem	 Nightshade, Cleodhna P. A.	 University of Glasgow	 University of Glasgow	2001	In this thesis, I shall examine the question of physicalism through two papers criticising the formulation of the doctrine. In the first chapter, I discuss Tim Carne's and D.H. Mellor's influential (1990) There Is No Question of Physicalism, in which they argue that there are no real criteria by which the science of psychology can be separated from the paradigmatically physical sciences, and so no principled reason to suppose that the predicates of pyschology do not describe real elements of the world's ontology whereas those of physics do. I shall explain why I find their arguments unconvincing, and to show how some of the reasons they consider not to support the noncontinuity of psychology with physics actually can support the distinction. Crane and Mellor take physicalism to be an epistemological doctrine, according to which the empirical world "contains just what a true and complete physical science would say it contains". Physicalism can, however, be taken as a metaphysical doctrine, and indeed I think that many modern physicalists do take it this way. In his (1998) What Are Physical Properties?, Chris Daly argues that no principled distinction can be drawn between physical and nonphysical properties, and that therefore any metaphysical programme which assumes such a distinction is misguided. I shall agree with much of his reasoning, but not with his 'downbeat' conclusion: while I agree that there are serious difficulties involved in setting constraints on the bounds of the physical, I think that enough can positively be said to make physicalism a meaningful position. Between the two papers, a fairly broad survey of some recent accounts of physicalism is made and these two distinct avenues explored: physicalism construed as a doctrine about science, and physicalism as a doctrine attempting to limit the contents of the world a priori through a definition of what it is to be a physical properties. All in all, I think that there is much to learn from these two papers, but not all of it is as negative, conclusive, or 'downbeat' as their authors might have intended. Rather, I think that some new directions are indicated by the failure of some of the avenues they explore.	 Thesis or dissertation	 B Philosophy (General)	519174	1
 Space and its dis-contents : new directions for intrinsicality, substance and dimensionality	 Walker-Dale, Heather	 University of St Andrews	 University of St Andrews	2013	 This dissertation examines key areas in ontology through the intersection of metaphysics and physics. I argue that modern physics gives us good cause to look for new metaphysical models in place of the classical conceptions of ‘object' and ‘space'. Part I addresses the object in itself, wherein I argue that physics, along with various philosophical concerns, encourages us to re-evaluate the intrinsic/ extrinsic distinction in favour of new classifications. In particular, I use conclusions of relativity theory and the acquisition of mass via the Higgs field as indications of the inadequacy of intrinsicality, concluding that the distinction is more trouble than it is worth. Part II examines the intersection of objects and space, wherein I criticise substantivalism and promote singular fundamental ontologies like relationalism and supersubstantivalism. I examine phenomena like spatial expansion and field theory as well as separability issues more generally to emphasise the lack of rationale for a substance dualism of ‘object material' and ‘space material'. I also challenge the coherence of substantivalism's ‘occupation relation' and the ease of interpreting mathematical models into physical terms. I conclude that, again, the classical notion of ‘object' and its substantival framework are misplaced and should be put aside in favour of developing monistic ontologies. Part III looks at space in itself and the properties commonly attributed to it. I explore issues of separability using key experiments, and what makes spaces ‘physically real', before an extended examination of dimensions and dimensionality, highlighting the confusion physicists express toward such a ubiquitous concept in modern physical theories. I also explore how we use dimensions and reasons for adopting realist or instrumentalist approaches toward them, arguing that much more work should be focused on this area. I conclude with ways in which physics motivates new metaphysical models and suggest improvements for future methodological partnerships.

 Nature and the Victorian entrepreneur : soap, sunlight and subjectivity	 Bergin, John Philip	 University of Hull	 University of Hull	1998	 At the heart of any philosophical exercise lies an understanding, be it explicated or taken for granted, of Nature. This thesis explores how Nature may have come to be understood as it is in our everyday life in the late twentieth century.The life and work of one Victorian Entrepreneur - William Hesketh Lever, First Viscount Leverhulme of the Western Isles - is explored to reveal a cultural dynamic behind entrepreneurial activity. His personal philosophies, his legacy including Port Sunlight village, the Leverhulme Trust and the product for which he is best known, namely Sunlight Soap, are examined to reveal the extent to which his understanding of Nature impacted on his thought. What he expressed in his philosophy as his thought is questioned and it is suggested that in Leverhulme's life and work can be seen the organising dynamic of subjectivity. Leverhulme, it is suggested, was as subject to this process of organisation as were, and are, the consumers of his products. The symbolism of soap is explored through order, not only in the literal sense of personal and public hygiene but, also, by extension, of order in the wider sense, that of organisation.Thus this thesis extends from the analysis of soap as a product and its marketability through the metaphor of Sunlight, which is taken to stand for an idealized, anthropocentric Nature, an understanding of which underpins the sociology of order upon which much organisation is premised. Soap as an intimate tool of personal organisation, through its contact with the body and with clothing is taken, in Freud's terminology, to be a yardstick of civilization. As a permanent feature of the mass-consumer market it shares the physical intimacies of the body, the domestic economy of the household and, in the wider economy, the technological developments in the saponide industry, the regulation of the governance of the 'environment' as well as impacting on 'popular' culture. As such it is particularly susceptible to analysis through some of the work of Foucault, in particular his work on subjectivity, power/knowledge and technology of the self.

 Selfless love and human flourishing : a theological and a secular perspective in dialogue	 Meszaros, Julia T.	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2012	 The point of departure of this thesis is derived from a modern tendency to create a dichotomy between selfless love and human flourishing. Modern attempts to liberate the human being from heteronomous oppression and the moral norms promoting this have sometimes led to the conclusion that selfless love is harmful to human flourishing. Such a conclusion has gained momentum also through modernist re-conceptualisations of the self as an autonomous but empty consciousness which must guard itself against determination by the other. In effect, significant thinkers have replaced the notion of selfless love with a call for self-assertion over against the other, as key to the individual person’s well-being. This has been matched by Christian dismissals of the individual’s pursuit of human flourishing. In the face of modern insights into the ‘desirous’ nature of the human being, modern Christian theology has equally struggled to sustain the tension between the traditional Christian notion of selfless or self-giving love and human beings’ desire to affirm themselves and to find personal fulfilment in this world. Strands of Christian theology have, for instance, affirmed a self-surrendering love at the cost of dismissing the individual’s worldly desires entirely. In this thesis, I outline this situation in modern thought and its problematic consequences. With a view to discerning whether selfless love and human flourishing can be re-connected, I then undertake close studies of the theologian Paul Tillich’s and the moral philosopher and novelist Iris Murdoch’s conceptualisations of the self and of love. As I will argue, Tillich’s and Murdoch’s engagement with modern thought leads them to develop accounts of the self, which correspond with understandings of love as both selfless and conducive to human flourishing. On the basis of their thought I thus argue that selfless love and human flourishing can be understood as interdependent even today.

 The radical humanism of Erich Fromm : a re-appropriation	 Durkin, Kieran	 University of Glasgow	 University of Glasgow	2013	 This thesis attempts to advance the underappreciated thought of Erich Fromm as both a crucial contribution to twentieth century intellectual history and a potentially pivotal point from which to transcend current theoretical impasses. In particular, I argue that Fromm’s radical humanism can participate in the rejuvenation of contemporary social theory, which is still largely constrained by the dual reductionism of positivism and poststructuralism, and that a return to it will encourage renewed theorising of, and empirical engagement with, the connections that obtain between the ‘psychological’ and the ‘social’, the ‘essential’ and the ‘constructed’, and the ‘is’ and the ‘ought’. I try to show that Fromm’s qualified essentialism and ethical normativism are sensible, viable, and desirable, and that they, coupled with his analytic social psychology, which is based on his underlying humanism and elaborated through a unique fusion of Marx and Freud, provide the basis for the development of practical strategies to realise humanism in the world. Perhaps above all, I try to show that there is a deceptive complexity and sophistication to Fromm’s ideas, which are all too often taken as simple and naïve.

 Multiverse deism	 Harper, Leland Royce	 University of Birmingham	 University of Birmingham	2016	 I argue that if one accepts the existence of a multiverse model that posits the existence of all possible realities, and also wants to maintain the existence of a God who exemplifies omnipotence, omnibenevolence and omniscience then the brand of God that he should ascribe to is one of deism rather than the God of classical theism. Given the nature and construct of such a multiverse, as well as some specific interpretations of the divine attributes, this points us to a God who is inactive in the natural world, not one who is. This deistic conception of God not only sits better with the idea of a multiverse and is also compatible with many arguments for theism, but it also responds to certain arguments for atheism better than the classical conception of God. I ultimately argue that deism ought to be given consideration as a plausible alternative conception to the classical conception of God, given the acceptance of a multiverse.

 A fractured dialectic : Søren Kierkegaard between idealism and materialism	 Burns, Michael	 University of Dundee	 University of Dundee	2014	This thesis aims to consider the contemporary relevance of the philosophical and religious project of Søren Kierkegaard by offering a systematic reading of his work against the backdrop of 19th century German idealism. Along with an emphasis on a systematic interpretation of a thinker usually considered to be wholly anti-systematic in aim and orientation, I also aim to show that through developing an ontological interpretation of the work of Kierkegaard the grounds are also created to develop a social and political interpretation of his work. Ultimately, I use the ontological and political reading of Kierkegaard developed in this work to not only show the relevance of this project to contemporary materialist philosophy, but equally to show how this version of Kierkegaard is capable of offering some crucial correctives to contemporary materialism.

 The concept of the vicarious humanity of Christ in the theology of Thomas Forsyth Torrance	 Kang, Phee Seng	 University of Aberdeen	 University of Aberdeen	1983	 This study is an attempt to show that the heart of Torrance's theology is the vicarious humanity of Jesus Christ. It is this vicarious humanity understood in the light of the incarnation of the Word that prescribes to Christian theology "both its matter and its content". Because God in his lordly freedom has chosen the way of the incarnation, Jesus Christ the incarnate Word is the one and only ontological ground of our being reconciled to God, our knowing of him, and our response to him. Against the dualist framework of much of modern christology which tries to distinguish between a Chirst of faith and a Jesus of history, Torrance emphasises a unitary approach which takes together both the theological Jesus and the historical Jesus in order that we may truly understand' him out of his own intrinsic significance. This unitary approach is indebted to the Judaeo-Christian tradition of the Scriptures. Indeed, any understanding of Jesus Christ is bound to be a distortion when severed from the witness of the Jews and of the apostles. Above all, Israel the Jews constitute the pre-history of the incarnation and Christ the Jew their Texos, Furthermore, the unitary approach implies that we have to take the very-God and very-man of Christ seriously in his one incarnate reality. In this God-man Jesus Christ, we have a true Mediator between God and man. Because Jesus Christ is [text unavailable]	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	374028	1

 Unity and pluralism	 Midgley, Gerald Robert	 City, University of London	 City University London	1992	 The central theme of this thesis is methodological pluralism in systems science: that is, how it might be possible to draw upon different systems methods that are traditionally thought to be based in incommensurable paradigms. The thesis is split into three sections. Section One begins by reviewing ideas about pluralism as they have been expressed in the literature on Critical Systems Thinking. This section also sets out the basic 'problem' pluralists have to deal with - that the approaches drawn upon are usually thought of as philosophically contradictory. An initial (partial) resolution of the problem is presented. Section Two takes a step back in order to examine why the focus upon pluralism is important. Here the social and ecological contexts of the debate are explored. It is discovered that many of the issues we are currently dealing with in systems science, especially complex global issues, can only be dealt with adequately through a pluralist research practice. Section Three looks at the implications of these social and ecological arguments for a pluralist systems science, and reexamines some of the philosophical ideas lying behind Critical Systems Thinking. Through this reexamination a different understanding of ontology begins to emerge. Having developed a set of interlinked arguments ranging from the ontological to the practical, the thesis concludes with an assertion that pluralism is actually necessary for the continued legitimation of systems science.

 Exposing romanticism : philosophy, literature, and the incomplete absolute	 Kollias, Hector	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	2003	The aim of this thesis is to present the fundamental philosophical positions of Early German Romanticism, focusing on the three following writers: J. C. F. Holderlin, Novalis, and F. Schlegel. Chapter 1 begins with an examination of the first-philosophical, or ontological foundations of Romanticism and discusses its appropriation and critique of the work of Fichte, arriving at an elucidation of Romantic ontology as an ontology of differencing and production. The second chapter looks at how epistemology is transformed, in the hands of the Romantics, and due to the attention they paid to language, semiotic theory, and the operations of irony in discourse, into poetology - a theory of knowledge, into a theory of poetic production. In the third chapter a confrontation between the philosophical positions of Romanticism and those of the main currents of German Idealism (Schelling, Hegel) is undertaken; through this confrontation, the essential trait of Romantic thought is arrived at, namely the thought of an incomplete Absolute, as opposed to the absolute as totality in Idealism. The final chapter considers the avenue left open by the notion of the incomplete Absolute, and the Romantics' chief legacy, namely the theory of literature; literature is thus seen as coextensive with philosophy, and analysed under three conceptual categories (the theory of genre, the fragment, criticism) which all betray their provenance from the thought lying at the core of Romanticism: the incomplete Absolute. Finally, in the conclusion a summation of this exposition of romanticism is presented, alongside a brief consideration of the relevance of the Romantic project in contemporary critical/philosophical debates.

 The international theory of Leonard Woolf : an exposition, analysis and assessment in the light of his reputation as a utopian	 Wilson, Peter Colin	 London School of Economics and Political Science (University of London)	 London School of Economics and Political Science	1997	 Leonard Woolf was one of the most prolific writers on international relations in Britain during the first half of the twentieth century. In common with most thinkers of the time he is universally regarded as a utopian. This is largely due to his support for the 'ill-fated' League of Nations and his 'simple-minded' belief in the possibility of progress through reason. This thesis examines Woolf's thought in the light of this denigratory interpretation. First, an analysis of the way in which the so-called utopian school has been represented in post-War International Relations shows that the core or defining characteristics of the school are far from clear. It is argued that the label 'utopian' is more a term of rhetoric than a meaningful social scientific category. Second, to the extent that certain defining 'utopian' features can be identified, it is argued that they apply to Woolf's thought only partially. Woolf was a diverse thinker both in terms of the subjects he tackled and the conclusions he reached. He was also an eclectic thinker who borrowed from a number of intellectual traditions: Owenism, Cobdenism, Fabianism, Radicalism, and Functionalism. The thesis shows that although flawed in a number of respects, Woolf's thought in three key areas - international government, imperialism, and international economic organization - defies the simple designation 'utopian'. The complexity of the picture is complicated further when Woolf's response to Carr's landmark 'realist' critique of utopianism is taken into account. Although Woolf disagreed with many aspects of Carr's analysis - notably his 'worship' of power and his belief in the 'permanence' of conflicting interests - it is clear that the two men, contrary to conventional wisdom, had much in common. These commonalities demonstrate that the dichotomy between 'utopianism' and 'realism' which has prevailed in interpretations of the thought of the period is of doubtful descriptive and analytical value.

 Models and metaphors in neuroscience : the role of dopamine in reinforcement learning as a case study	 Kyle, Robert	 University of Edinburgh	 University of Edinburgh	2012	Neuroscience makes use of many metaphors in its attempt to explain the relationship between our brain and our behaviour. In this thesis I contrast the most commonly used metaphor - that of computation driven by neuron action potentials - with an alternative view which seeks to understand the brain in terms of an agent learning from the reward signalled by neuromodulators. To explore this reinforcement learning model I construct computational models to assess one of its key claims — that the neurotransmitter dopamine signals unexpected reward, and that this signal is used by the brain to learn control of our movements and drive goal-directed behaviour. In this thesis I develop a selection of computational models that are motivated by either theoretical concepts or experimental data relating to the effects of dopamine. The first model implements a published dopamine-modulated spike timing-dependent plasticity mechanism but is unable to correctly solve the distal reward problem. I analyse why this model fails and suggest solutions. The second model, more closely linked to the empirical data attempts to investigate the relative contributions of firing rate and synaptic conductances to synaptic plasticity. I use experimental data to estimate how model neurons will be affected by dopamine modulation, and use the resulting computational model to predict the effect of dopamine on synaptic plasticity. The results suggest that dopamine modulation of synaptic conductances is more significant than modulation of excitability. The third model demonstrates how simple assumptions about the anatomy of the basal ganglia, and the electrophysiological effects of dopamine modulation can lead to reinforcement learning like behaviour. The model makes the novel prediction that working memory is an emergent feature of a reinforcement learning process. In the course of producing these models I find that both theoretically and empirically based models suffer from methodological problems that make it difficult to adequately support such fundamental claims as the reinforcement learning hypothesis. The conclusion that I draw from the modelling work is that it is neither possible, nor desirable to falsify the theoretical models used in neuroscience. Instead I argue that models and metaphors can be valued by how useful they are, independently of their truth. As a result I suggest that we ought to encourage a plurality of models and metaphors in neuroscience. In Chapter 7 I attempt to put this into practice by reviewing the other transmitter systems that modulate dopamine release, and use this as a basis for exploring the context of dopamine modulation and reward-driven behaviour. I draw on evidence to suggest that dopamine modulation can be seen as part of an extended stress response, and that the function of dopamine is to encourage the individual to engage in behaviours that take it away from homeostasis. I also propose that the function of dopamine can be interpreted in terms of behaviourally defining self and non-self, much in the same way as inflammation and antibody responses are said to do in immunology.

 Bakhtin, carnival and comic theory	 Taylor, Ben	 University of Nottingham	 University of Nottingham	1995	 In Rabelais and His World, Mikhail Bakhtin presents us both with a theory of carnival, and with an account of the historical decline of the carnivalesque since the Renaissance. This thesis uses Bakhtin's work as a point of departure for an analysis of particular moments in the history of post-Renaissance comic theory. It is argued both Bakhtin's account of carnivalesque decline provides us with a potent framework within which to perform such an analysis, and that this in turn facilitates a thorough interrogation of, and engagement with, Bakhtin's theory of carnival. Chapter One outlines Bakhtin's theory, identifying its historical and utopian dimensions, and exploring some of the problems which it generates. Chapter Two addresses some of the methodological issues relating to a historical analysis of comic theory, and situates Bakhtin's theory of carnival in relation to recent work in the area of comic theory. The remaining chapters focus on particular comic theory texts in the light of Bakhtin's thesis. Chapter Three contrasts Kant's analysis of humour with Schopenhauer's theory, relating the former to its Enlightenment context and the latter to its Romantic context. Chapter Four explores Bergson's discussion of laughter, situating it in relation to modernism, while Chapter Five reviews Freud's theory of jokes, examining the proximity between the structures of carnival and the structures of the Freudian joke. Chapter Six focuses on a Brechtian theory of comedy, assessing its relationship with the carnivalesque tradition, while Chapter Seven attempts to update Bakhtin's thesis in relation to contemporary configurations by exploring recent arguments concerning the comic credentials of postmodern culture. It is argued in conclusion that, if post-Renaissance culture has witnessed a decline in the significance of the carnivalesque, then the trajectory of that decline has undergone' a complex series of historical shifts and reversals.

 Coping with criticism and praise : the emotional well-being of people with intellectual disabilities	 Ackland, Lynn	 University of Glasgow	 University of Glasgow	2011	 Background: Through their experiences of stigma and discrimination, people with intellectual disabilities may develop negative beliefs about themselves and compare themselves negatively to others. This may make them more sensitive to criticism from others. In addition, receiving praise may be discrepant with the self-views of people with intellectual disabilities and they may be less likely to benefit from praise. Being distressed by criticism has been associated with vulnerability to mental health difficulties in the general adult population. It is not known how people with intellectual disabilities perceive and experience criticism and praise. Method: Two study groups were recruited; one with intellectual disabilities, one without. The praise and criticism task (PACT) was developed for the study. Participants were presented with ten scenes in which they were asked to imagine someone saying something positive (praise) or negative (criticism). Following the presentation of each scene, participants were asked about their emotions, beliefs, thoughts and actions. Results: People with intellectual disabilities were more likely to believe and be distressed by criticism. Contrary to predictions, this group were also more likely to believe and experience positive affect in response to praise. No differences were found in the frequency of self-supporting thoughts or actions reported in response to criticism. Conclusions: The results may represent a difference in the way people with intellectual disabilities develop their sense of self and may suggest that the self-perceptions of this group are more dynamic and reliant on the views of others. In theory, such sensitivity could make people more vulnerable to mental health difficulties. On the other hand, the possibilities for positive influence have implications for psychological and social interventions.	 Thesis or dissertation	 B Philosophy (General)	541271	0

 Jacques de Vitry's Historia Orientalis : reform, crusading, and the Holy Land after the Fourth Lateran Council	 Vandeburie, Jan	 University of Kent	 University of Kent	2015	Jacques de Vitry (†1240), a noted preacher in Brabant and Languedoc, served as canon regular of Saint-Nicholas d’Oignies (1211-16), bishop of Acre (1216-29) and auxiliary bishop of Liège (1226-29), and ultimately as cardinal-bishop of Tusculum (1229-1240). Whilst his letters, sermons, and the Historia Occidentalis have been extensively studied, the Historia Orientalis, Jacques’s encyclopedic work on the Holy Land, has so far escaped any such interest. Considered as yet another crusading history or pilgrimage guide drawing on previous writings, the few editions and brief studies of this work published since the nineteenth century are based neither on a detailed textual analysis nor on a complete investigation of the manuscript tradition. This thesis, therefore, addresses an important gap in the historiographical debate by providing a detailed analysis of the contents of the Historia Orientalis and its sources, in combination with an examination of the manuscript tradition up to the early fourteenth century. In it, I argue that the work is composed of different genres, each addressing a topic that served Jacques’s agenda and his activities as theologian, preacher, historian, pilgrim, and crusader. Moreover, by examining the rich manuscript tradition, I establish the book’s legacy and show that Jacques’s contemporaries perceived the text as an eclectic work. Jacques’s combination of different popular genres contributed to the influence of the text which is preserved in no fewer than 126 extant manuscripts. The thesis falls into three sections. In the first, I introduce my investigation and provide a long overdue revised biographical note and contextualisation of Jacques’s writings. In the four chapters of the second section, I analyse the text to see how Jacques combined the editing of existing source material with his personal knowledge into a work that served the reform and crusade agenda of the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215. The four chapters discuss the medieval genres that can be found in Jacques’s work: a history of the crusades, an account on Islam, a description of the Holy Land, and an ethnographical treatise. In the third section, using codicological research to discuss the text’s compilation, influence, readership, and legacy in the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, I argue that each genre found within the Historia was intended for and read by a different audience, thus explaining the wide appeal of the work as a whole. The sixth chapter focuses on the early manuscript tradition and dissemination of the Historia Orientalis while the seventh chapter addresses, on the one hand, the use of these manuscripts and the relationship to other texts in the same codex and, on the other hand, the authors who copied or used Jacques’s text in their own works. By combining a detailed textual analysis with extensive manuscript research, this investigation into the contents, readership and legacy of the Historia Orientalis sheds new light on the mechanisms behind the dissemination and influence of religious propaganda, as well as highlights Jacques’s seminal contribution to Church reform and the approach to crusading in the thirteenth century in accordance with the agenda set by the Fourth Lateran Council.

 A strategy for culture : five nation study of arts support systems	 Tattersall, J.	 City, University of London	 City University London	1986	This thesis seeks to apply some concepts and theories from predominantly post 1960 research in organisational behaviour to the study of the Arts Council as reflected through its policies, in the belief that few, if any, real attempts have thus far been made by academics to relate some of the profound difficulties of the public administration of the art to this branch of the sciences. The project is based on an examination of the assumption with which the Arts Council historically has justified both its general operations and its particular decisions. A close examination is made of past and recent statements of policy (I am assuming that administrators often make policy and advise in the making of policy and am treating decision making and policy making as synonymous for purposes of this thesis), the main aim being to identify the various ideological and structural determinants which bear upon decision making processes necessary for a subsequent evaluation of the various representative systems. These determinants vary from political pressures to aesthetic preconceptions, and overt to covert hierarchical power structures within the framework. Specific areas of concern have revolved around the problems of co-ordination, accountability and control of public subsidy to the arts and in particular, what model or models of organisational structure and decision-making processes might successfully reconcile traditional cultural criteria and alternative contemporary conceptions of artistic and cultural development and worth, including all current non-art criticism. In particular, the research has focused on what might be termed the Arts Council's 'secondary accountabilities-' (the word 'accountability' is usually only used when explaining its formal relationships with Government), in respect to artistic standards, artists and members of the general public. This is accountability imposed from 'below" the quango, a relatively undeveloped concept which this thesis examines in much greater detail. My points are illustrated by an examination of the policies of the arts agencies in Great Britain, New Zealand, Australia, America and Canada. Further comparisons are made between the Arts Council of Great Britain and Sports Council of this country in view of the proposals in New Zealand and Australia for a more integrated policy framework based on concepts of recreation and leisure which could result in a new Department of Recreation, Arts and Sport whose primary function would be to develop a national recreation policy to allow for coordinated development of all aspects of recreation, arts and sport. The examination is made largely from the point of view of organisation theory. For while I believe the cultural debate outlined in chapter one represents the crucial question for arts councils to resolve, organisation theory fortuitously illustrates these larger issues and also suggests some means of resolving the conflict between public accountability and responsibility to the development of the arts.

The Lambeth Conferences and the development of Anglican ecclesiology, 1867-1978	 Thomas, Philip H. E.	 Durham University	 Durham University	1982	 The discussion of Anglican ecclesiology usually concentrates on particular periods of the Church of England's history. This thesis proceeds from the standpoint of the Anglican Communion. When Anglicans found themselves to be outside the bounds of the English establishment, they were forced to make a response to their new social, political and religious environment. They did this by founding Churches upon the basis of voluntary compacts and organising them under constitutional synods. This thesis argues first that the new challenges led to a changed perspective on received Anglican doctrine and liturgies, episcopal government and the Church's relationship to the State, and secondly, that in the light of this experience Anglicans have transformed the definition of their own communion and the claims made for the whole Anglican theological tradition. It is in this second area that the Lambeth Conferences are important. By reference to the Conferences' discussion of Christian unity and Anglican organization (often utilising previously unexamined records) the thesis examines the debates over Anglican doctrine, authority, organization and mission. Successive expositions of the Lambeth Quadrilateral form one line of investigation together with a recognition of the ambiguous position of the English reformation formularies in the Anglican Communion. Another approach is taken through the developing conviction that Anglicanism consists of a fellowship of "national Churches", With these debates underlying questions of authority, comprehensiveness, conciliarity and ministry are also considered within the framework of gathering Anglican self-consciousness. A number of such elements of theory are finally tested by their capacity to assist Anglicanism in its adaptation to changing theological, ecumenical and social pressures. The study concludes that, in the Lambeth Conference documents, the Anglican Communion is able to present a distinct, though not unique, and by no means final contribution to Anglican and ecumenical theology.

 'Between hopelessness and ambivalence' : young Egyptians, secondary schooling and the Arab Spring in urban Cairo	 Fadil, Mamdouh Kamal Hakim	 University of Sussex	 University of Sussex	2014	This thesis is based upon ethnographic fieldwork carried out in and around three secondary schools and Tahrir Square in urban Cairo between October 2009 and December 2011. It explores the lives of young Egyptians at the time of their secondary schooling and the Arab spring through examining the contradictions and ambivalence of the coming of age for middle class young people inside the school and in the wider everyday life in urban Cairo. This thesis seeks to understand, by examining the social theory on the tension between structure and agency, the way through which disciplinarian interventions enable youth's articulation of critical dispositions and forms of resistance. This thesis, whilst it embarks by looking at the deterioration of the formal schooling system in Egypt after thirty years under Mubarak's rule, examines the extent to which the everyday educational studentship circumstances had constrained the sorts of subjects that Egyptian youth could become and which would constitute them as young and educated in contemporary Egypt. Whilst education, in its broader meaning, emerged as being undeniably crucial for young Egyptians' project for social mobility, secondary schools are presented not as venues for socialisation or reproduction of inequalities but rather as an ambivalent and contradictory resource. The young Egyptians who were the subjects of this thesis negotiated meritocratic aspirations at the intersections of their transversal educational circumstances, and the norms of patriarchy and subordination of their wider everyday life. The forms of exclusion and tension about the future have affected young Egyptians' articulation of their critical dispositions of hopelessness and ambivalence. Their engagement in the Tahrir riots and occupational actions and demanding their right to the city, manifested their emerging political consciousness and capacity to produce new spatial meanings and practices.

 A study in the transformation and continuity of Akan religious ritual and ceremony in Gomoa, central Ghana	 Antwi, S. A.	 University of Aberdeen	 University of Aberdeen	1980	 The study is about the transformation and continuity of religious ritual and ceremony in Gomoa, an Akan society in Ghana. It is examined partly in terms of the strong influence of a mission-connected church, the Wesleyan/Methodists and partly in terms of colonialism; especially the changing political and economic structures and their effect on Akan sooio-religious institutions and their functional equivalent.The study offers two divergent, yet Complementary examples in this process. In the first, a detailed account is given of the stool festival in five Gomoa towns, as it takes place each year between July and September, and the expression it provides of chieftainship and priesthood. The description covers rituals, religious texts and iconography. The second example, a conscious Christian representation or adaptation of the indigenous Akan chieftaincy and priesthood function as seen in an independent church, Musama Disco Christo Church, also contains some ritual texts and iconography. Some of the texts are given in full in the appendix.In the first model, we point out that the cycle of religious festivals unites participants and acts as the sanction of their loyalty, amity, co-operation and respect of one another's rights.At one level of analysis, we realize that both verbal and non-verbal acts during the religious ceremonies are an enactment of the ideas of the Gomoa/Akan about the ordering of their this-world view, and the moral reciprocal relations between classes of beings.At another level, the acts attempt to establish a contract between mortaland immortal beings. What seems to emerge when one looks at the first model, i historically, is not only the sense of links with the past, but also diversities within the present. The diversities and differences lead one to postulate two broad types of indigenous religious phenomena: truly traditional practices and 'neo' traditional developments.A further comparison between cases one and two reveals ritual similarities and differences. Both are seen to follow the models of their time and tradition. They also emphasize the emotional and rational aspects of Akan spirituality as seen in theological thought, thus making them concrete and effective to devotees.

 Experiencing lyric poetry : emotional responses, philosophical thinking and moral inquiry	 Simecek, Karen	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	2013	 To date, the most substantial accounts of our engagement with literature have focused on prose-fiction, in particular the novel, drawing on issues of plot, character and narrative in explaining our understanding of literary works. These accounts do not consider how the poetic features of a literary work may affect our reading experience and how this contributes to the meaning of the work. In this thesis I show the philosophical importance of the experience of reading poetry for the role it can play in inquiry, in particular, how such an experience can facilitate philosophical thinking and active inquiry. Adopting a reader-response view of our engagement with poetry, I argue that the experience of reading lyric poetry can make a valuable contribution to philosophical inquiry by enriching our conceptual understanding. The reading experience helps us to forge explicit awareness of our concepts and the networks of associations and beliefs that determine our use of them. Understanding poetry necessarily requires attending to the unity of form and content, and the particular perspectives on offer in the poem. This complex whole sustains perspectives and emotions where character and narrative are lacking. I argue that the perspectival nature of our reading experience is important for philosophical inquiry into aspects of human life. Encountering the perspectives of the poem helps to activate our own perspectives through our emotional and intellectual responses, bringing into focus what we value. I apply this argument to the moral domain, arguing that poetry can facilitate moral inquiry in particular by exposing moral significance in our concepts, helping us to feel what is at stake, and by testing our moral understanding. The way in which the poetic examples discussed engage us emotionally, imaginatively and cognitively (through the reading experience) help us address moral questions from distinctive and valuable perspectives, which provide us with moral insights of value in philosophical inquiry.

 The effects of violent conflict and displacement on citizen engagement : a case study from Northern Uganda	 Oosterom, Marjoke Anika	 University of Sussex	 University of Sussex	2014	This thesis aims to contribute to an understanding of how citizenship is constructed, sensed and practiced by people who have experienced violent conflict and displacement. In the Acholi region of Uganda, the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) created large-scale insecurity and mass-displacement between the late 1980s until the region returned to stability in 2006. In this thesis I compare two conflict-affected locations in the Acholi region with one non-affected location in Lango region. The overall proposition of this study is that the experience of protracted conflict and displacement leads to a lack of a sense of citizenship and to diminished forms of citizen engagement, due to the limited opportunity for learning and experiencing the practice of citizenship. I used qualitative research methods during ten months of fieldwork in 2010. For an analysis of people's sense of citizenship, I studied how people perceive and feel themselves to be members of the wider political community; as members of the Acholi tribe and as citizens of Uganda. For the analysis of the practice of citizenship I studied various forms of citizen engagement: with local authorities, in community institutions, for development and for accountability purposes. Numerous challenges to citizen participation exist across Uganda. These include a lack of knowledge about the system and lack of self-confidence, barriers associated with the micropolitics of participation, and democratic deficits of the overall political system. However, underlying reasons for non-participation can vary. In Acholi, some of these reasons are attributable to people's experiences during the war. I conclude that protracted conflict diminishes a sense of citizenship and radically changes the social environment in which active citizenship is learnt, through the narrowing and securitisation of institutions and the public sphere. The sense and practice that exist in the post-conflict situation are therefore characterised by certain ideas, perceptions, emotions and behaviours that were developed during the conflict.

 Writing in real-time, fictions of digitization : the novels of Don DeLillo and Dave Eggers	 Muscolino, Stephen J.	 University of Glasgow	 University of Glasgow	2017	By tracking the intersection of contemporary fiction and the information technologies of the digital age, this thesis argues that the narratives being produced over the past ten years have evolved into a distinct genre of literature, one where the aesthetics of fragmentation and postmodern uncertainty must confront the new realities of a digitally saturated culture and society. In order to demonstrate this alteration in contemporary fiction, this thesis considers novels written within the past ten years that reflect on this new form of textuality, namely Don DeLillo’s Cosmopolis (2003) and David Eggers’ The Circle (2013). These texts demonstrate a paradigm shift in contemporary literature, a new kind of fiction in which American society, culture, economics, and politics, are all directly affected by various forms of digital mediatisation. These authors reflect an altered cultural zeitgeist within their fiction—writings which can be differentiated from the postmodern literary aesthetic—prompted by neoteric digital technologies coupled with the ubiquitous nature of the Internet. Although this topic is broad and covers multiple fields of scholarly interests, my thesis nonetheless concerns itself with a very specific line of questioning: will our authors have the imaginative wherewithal and social sensitivity to keep pace with changes brought forth by the explosion of information technologies? If so, what type of fiction is likely to emerge from this new digital environment? By taking a focused approach and using contemporary literature as representative of these massive social, economic, and political transformations, my research recalls Kurt Vonnegut’s “Canary in the Coal Mine” dictum: the writer has always been the first to notice the dramatic effects of technology on the individual and the culture at large.

 The survivors of Israel : attitudes towards the national salvation among late Second Temple Jewish protest groups, and implications for the literature and beliefs, and for the definition, of pre-Christian Judaism	 Elliott, Mark Adam	 University of Aberdeen	 University of Aberdeen	1993	 The predominant view among scholars that pre-Christian Judaism was essentially nationalistic in its election theology has recently been given new momentum. This view, however, continues to create difficulties for an historical understanding of Christianity. Moreover a reconsideration of this view is demanded by indications of an important judgement-of-Israel theme and an exclusivist soteriology among a number of important pre-Christian Jewish groups. A valid approach to such groups must take into consideration their perception of, and protest against, widespread apostasy in Israel throughout the Second Temple period. Adopting a defensive in group/out group posture and mentality their theology tends to embrace highly individual, conditional and dualistic understandings of covenant, and their literature and beliefs are influenced by a dominating 'soteriological dualism', seen in their pneumatology, their growing corporate consciousness, their literary forms, their messianology and their eschatology. Far from evidencing an essentially nationalistic perspective, literature and beliefs function socially to define and legitimize the division in Israel which has resulted from the apostasy of the nation, and to validate and vindicate the view that these groups represent the faithful in Israel. This consciousness of being the elect comes to clearest expression in the nuanced view of Restoration sustained by these groups, and in their unique Destruction-preservation soteriology, which climaxes in the view that the group of righteous represents the sole remnant or 'survivors' of Israel. All of this demands a radical reconsideration of many former comparative approaches to the NT.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	318103	0

 Mainstream marginality : professional projects and the appeal of complementary and alternative medicines in a context of medical pluralism	 Cant, Sarah	 Canterbury Christ Church University	 Canterbury Christ Church University	2017	 This narrative critically reviews my contribution to the development and maturation of a sociology of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Through the application of qualitative methodologies, my work has documented the emergence of a ‘new’ medical pluralism, focussing on the professional development of CAM as practiced by non-medically qualified practitioners and nurses and midwives, and has provided an understanding for the groundswell of appeal of CAM to both users and practitioners. With reference to neo-Weberian, Foucauldian and feminist theories of occupational formation, the research has provided insight into CAM ‘professional projects’, detailing the attempts to secure market share, broker trust relations, and discipline work conduct. My work has also revealed the enduring capacity of (patriarchal) biomedicine to shape CAM practice and health care delivery. As a consequence, CAM is described as being situated in a position of ‘mainstream marginality’ – popular, but peripherally located in state-sanctioned health care, with an appeal to groups of users and practitioners who themselves feel marginalised. As such, my work has contributed to an appreciation of the attractions of CAM and its empowering potentials, and the dynamics of biomedical power, professionalisation and professionalism in relation to jurisdictional battles for market share. Through critical reflection on my work, however, I note there is space for further exploration into: the opportunities for affective change and collaboration that can be fostered in integrated/integrative clinics; the ways in which biomedical dominance might be mutating; the different ways in which wellbeing, efficacy and evidence might be conceptualised; the possibility of integrating post-colonial theory and anthropology with sociology to produce a globalised analysis of medical pluralisms.

 The prevalence and psychological characteristics of un-apprehended deliberate firesetters living in the UK	 Barrowcliffe, Emma Rebecca	 University of Kent	 University of Kent	2017	 Deliberate firesetting has huge emotional, social, and economic impact.

 Equitable access to human biological resources in developing countries : benefit sharing without undue inducement	 Chennells, Roger Scarlin	 University of Central Lancashire	 University of Central Lancashire	2014	 The main research question of this thesis is: How can cross-border access to human genetic resources, such as blood or DNA samples, be governed to achieve equity for developing countries? Access to and benefit sharing for human biological resources is not regulated through an international legal framework such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, which applies only to plants, animals and micro-organisms as well as associated traditional knowledge. This legal vacuum for the governance of human genetic resources can be attributed (in part) to the concern that benefit sharing might provide undue inducements to research participants and their communities. This thesis shows that: (a) Benefit sharing is crucial to avoiding the exploitation of developing countries in genomic research. (b) With functioning research ethics committees, undue inducement is less of a concern in genetic research than in other medical research (e.g. clinical trials). (c) Concerns remain over research involving indigenous populations and some recommendations are provided. In drawing its conclusions, the thesis resolves a highly pressing topic in global bioethics and international law. Originally, it combines bioethical argument with jurisprudence, in particular reference to the law of equity and the legal concepts of duress (coercion), unconscionable dealing, and undue influence.

 Performing gender in the 'theatre of war' : embodying the invasion, counterinsurgency and exit strategy in Afghanistan	 Laastad Dyvik, Synne	 University of Sussex	 University of Sussex	2013	 This thesis offers a critical feminist reading of the war in Afghanistan, from invasion, through the practice of counterinsurgency, to the training of the Afghan National Army as a central part of NATO's exit strategy. Empirically it focuses on the discourses, policies and practices of the US and Norwegian militaries in Afghanistan. It draws on a range of material including military doctrine and policy, parliamentary discussions, public policy documents, interviews, political statements and soldiers' memoirs. Deploying the theoretical framework of performative gender with an emphasis on embodiment, it shows how particular gendered bodies are called into being and how the distinct practices of war in Afghanistan produce and rely on a series of multiple, fluid and, at times, contradictory performances of masculinity and femininity. It demonstrates how gendered performances should not be considered superfluous, but rather integral to the practices of war. It illustrates this, first, by examining the production of the (in) visible ‘body in the burqa' alongside the ‘protective masculinity' of Western politicians in the legitimation of the invasion; second, through the ‘soldier-	 Thesis or dissertation	DS350 Afghanistan ; JZ1464 Scope of international relations with regard to countries ; territories ; regions ; etc. ; JZ6385 The armed conflict.

Fr Patrick Lavelle : the rise and fall of an Irish nationalist, 1825-1886	 Moran, Gerard Patrick Joseph	 Durham University	 Durham University	1992	This is a study of Father Patrick Lavelle, one of the most radical members of the post- Famine Irish Catholic Church. Lavelle, who came from a comfortable tenant-farming background in Mayo, pursued his clerical studies in Maynooth and from an early stage displayed an aggressive and uncompromising manner. His confrontations with John Miley at the Irish College, Paris; Bishop Thomas Plunket in Partry, Cardinal Paul Cullen, John O'Connor Power and others gained him a reputation as a pugnacious and zealous opponent. However, the more gentler side of his nature was revealed when he met Sir Arthur Guinness in Cong in the 1870s.While Lavelle is commonly regarded as a tenacious radical, it is often overlooked that he laboured relentlessly for his poor, oppressed parishioners of Partry against the twin dangers of Evangelicalism and famine. His pastoral duties were similar to those of other clerics in the west of Ireland and highlight the importance of the priest in the survival of their congregations. Lavelle's fame is normally associated with the Fenian movement, in which he defended the right of Irish people to rebel against tyrannical government. This policy brought him into conflict with Paul Cullen who continuously endeavoured to have Lavelle suspended by the Vatican. Lavelle argued that the Fenian organisation had never been specifically named by the Church. He was able to pursue his radical course in Britain and Ireland because of John MacHale's protection. It is argued that Lavelle espoused militant nationalism because of the demise of constitutional nationalism, a position adopted by many other Irishmen. Once it became clear that the Fenians could not deliver on the national question, Lavelle and others reverted to parliamentary agitation and the Home Rule party. During this period Lavelle's fame declined, symbolising the clergy's fading power in Irish politics in the 1870s and the rise of the Catholic urban middle classes. Nevertheless, Lavelle has to be regarded as the link between the radical pre-Famine Irish Church and the socially aware clerics of the post-Land League Church.

 Misinterpretation and the meaning of signs in Old English poetry	 Bailey, Hannah McKendrick	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2015	 This thesis investigates how Old English poets understood the processes of signification and interpretation through analysis of depictions of poor interpreters and the use of 'sign terms' such as tacen and beacen in the longer Old English poems. The first chapter deals with the Beowulf Manuscript, the second and third chapters consider Elene and Andreas within the network of related poems found in the Vercelli Book and the begin- ning of the Exeter Book, the fourth chapter is on the Junius Manuscript, and the conclusion looks at the use of the 'bright sign' motif across all four major poetic codices. I suggest that there is a 'heroic sign-bearing interpreter' character-type which several of the poems utilize or ironically invert, and that poor interpretation is nearly always asso- ciated with hesitation, which often resembles acedia. I also argue that there is greater nuance in the poems' depictions of modes of understanding than has previously been acknowledged: Eve in Genesis B does not stand for the senses which subvert the mind, but rather models the limits of rational thought as a means of understanding God, and Elene does not depict a simple opposition of letter and spirit, but a threefold mental pro- cess of learning about the Cross with analogues in exegesis and Augustine's Trinity of the Soul. Finally, I argue that there is a 'bright sign' motif which functions within a brightness-sign-covenant concept cluster, whose evocation as a traditional poetic unit is not identical to the denotation and connotation of its constituent parts. These strands of inquiry taken together demonstrate how Old English poems invest signs with significance by tapping into a specifically poetic network of allusion.

 Verbal behaviour development for children with autism	 Degli Espinosa, Francesca	 University of Southampton	 University of Southampton	2011	 The utility of functional accounts of language development in establishing the emergence of generalised verbal behaviour in children with autism was evaluated through a programme of research that also investigated ways in which interactions between speaker and listener behaviour can be manipulated to maximise the effectiveness of language-based interventions. Firstly, the Early Behavioural Intervention Curriculum (EBIC) was developed as a comprehensive framework for delivering Early Intensive Behavioural Intervention (EIBI) to children with autism. Secondly, the effectiveness of the EBIC was evaluated through analysis of process data collected during the Southampton Childhood Autism Project (SCAmP). Two subsequent studies provided further controlled investigation of the emergence of naming at the single-word level, the first in vocal children with autism, and the second in non-vocal children with autism who sign. Lastly, research was carried out to evaluate teaching procedures developed to establish complex conditional discriminations in children with autism on the basis of joint control by two types of speaker behaviour. Overall, findings reported indicate that the EBIC provides an effective framework for EIBI in autism, that theoretical accounts of naming and joint control provide a practical basis for developing effective procedures for teaching verbal behaviour to children with autism, and that functional accounts of language development provide effective means of establishing both generalised verbal behaviour and other key life skills in children with autism	 Thesis or dissertation	 B Philosophy (General)	543400	0

 Translating the Bible : a critical analysis of E.A. Nida's theory of dynamic equivalence and its impact upon recent Bible translations	 Nichols, Anthony Howard	 University of Sheffield	 University of Sheffield	1996	 Developments in translation theory have externalized processes used intuitively by translators for centuries. The literature on Bible translation in particular is dominated by Eugene A. Nida and his proteges whose work is informed by a wealth of intercultural experience. This thesis is a critique of the Dynamic Equivalence (DE) theory of translation propounded by Nida, exemplified in the Good News Bible, and promoted in non- Western languages by the United Bible Societies. Section I of the thesis surveys the history of translation, its theory and problems, and describes relevant developments in linguistics. Section II examines Nida's sociolinguistic model and his methods of grammatical and semantic analysis, transfer and restructuring. Section III focuses on the translation of seven texts representing different Bible genres into Septuagint Greek, English and Indonesian versions, noting the distinctive features of DE translations. Section IV takes up and examines key issues that have arisen: the nature of Biblical language, the handling of important Biblical motifs and technical terminology, and the implications of naturalness and explicitness in translation. Nida has provided excellent discussion on most translation problems, as well as useful tools for semantic analysis. However, the DE model is found to be defective for Bible translation. Firstly, it underestimates the intricate relationship of form and meaning in language. Secondly, while evaluation of translation must take account of its purpose and intended audience, 'equivalence' defined in terms of the receptor's reactions is impossible to measure, and blurs the distinction between 'translation’ and ‘communication'. Thirdly, the determinative role given to receptor response constantly jeopardizes the historical and cultural 'otherness' of the Biblical text. Finally the drive for explicitness guarantees that indigenous receptors must approach Scripture through a Western grid and denies them direct access to the Biblical universe of discourse.

 Narrative structure and philosophical debates in Tristram Shandy and Jacques le fataliste	 Whiskin, Margaux Elizabeth	 University of St Andrews	 University of St Andrews	2012	 The aim of the present thesis is to analyse how the narrative affects the various philosophical debates in Tristram Shandy and Jacques le fataliste. Contrary to what one expects from a philosophical novel, Sterne and Diderot do not impose upon the reader an authorial and authoritative discourse. Dominant discourses are constantly challenged and contradicted. The philosophical debates in both novels remain open and are left without a conclusion. The author's voice is but one amongst many others, and it is the narrative which maintains the dialogue between them by preventing one particular voice from invalidating the others. My argument hinges on Bakhtinian dialogism, which can be defined as the presence of interacting voices and views. In Tristram Shandy and Jacques le fataliste, dialogism occurs through the narrative structure allowing for the confrontation of the contradictory discourses in the philosophical debates, and enabling them to engage in dialogue, instead of establishing the authorial voice as the sole valid discourse in the text. Through those contradictions, the philosophical content takes on a different form, that of a refusal of systematic discourse. No dogmatic view is forced upon the reader. Sterne and Diderot do not offer a solution to the various philosophical questions debated in their novels. However, they do offer a philosophical method whereby the confrontation of contradictory ideas creates a dynamic for the pursuit of truth.

 Modern tragedy : Michael Cacoyannis' early films	 Papageorgopoulou, Maria Aikaterini	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2015	This thesis is an interpretation of three films by the Greek Cypriot director Michael Cacoyannis: Stella, 1955), To koritsi me ta mavra/A Girl in Black, 1956 and To teleftaio psema/A Matter of Dignity, 1958. These films appear early in Cacoyannis' career and very little has been written on them. My thesis seeks to show that they are accomplished and complex films, which merit close attention, both in virtue of their dramatic form and because of the ethical questions they raise regarding individual autonomy and the force of archaic ethical norms. The aim of this thesis is to interpret these films by examining the evolving motivations of their protagonists. The thesis seeks to show that the dramatic form of the films renders the agency of the protagonist partly intransparent. In order to show this, my thesis examines, on the one hand, how characterisation, perspective, character relationships and the development of the drama provide an internal context for agency in each film. On the other hand, the interpretation seeks to tease out the ethical implications and stakes of the dramatic action in each film. These implications, I argue, are structured by a thematic ambivalence running through these films between modernity, understood as subjective freedom, and archaic ethical norms, implying a limit to subjective freedom. In the approach to the films' dramatic form and their ethical implications, I am indebted to Hegel's aesthetic and ethical theory. I use the Hegelian term 'modern tragedy' to characterise both the dramatic form of these films and the ethical situation of their protagonists. I also situate these films within international auteur cinema of the 1950s and early 1960s. The thesis aims, thus, to contribute to scholarship on European auteur cinema of the mid-20th century. It also aims to be a contribution to the study of agency and ethics in film in general.

 Patriarchy and discordant discourses in the contemporary Roman Catholic Church : the voices of priests and women in parish settings	 Sharp, Geraldine	 University of Plymouth	 University of Plymouth	1998	 This thesis explores the sexual theology and contemporary teachings of the Roman Catholic Church and considers their implications for women and priests. It examines the salience and relevance of traditional teaching in the everyday lives of priests and women. It questions the link between a traditionally formed priesthood and the customary beliefs and practices of 'ordinary' English Catholics. Feminist scholarship has produced powerful insights into the ways in which organised religion has subordinated women through patriarchal structures and organisation, although there has been little exploration of the gendered nature of Catholic sexual theology. This thesis suggests that the negative construction of women's bodies in sexual theology, underpins the continued subordination of women in the Catholic Church. It argues that religious inscriptions on women's bodies are central to the continued control of women Al a patriarchal Church. This thesis uses patriarchy, sexual theology, and power and authority, as the main themes of discussion. An examination of the discourses of traditional sexual theology and contemporary teaching reveals that patriarchal inscriptions on women's bodies are central to each of these themes and they are mutually supportive and sustaining. Sociological research has demonstrated a disjuncture between contemporary teaching and the beliefs and practices of 'ordinary' English Catholics. This thesis adds a gender dimension by suggesting that the English parish is a place of contradictions in which differing attitudes towards women are a significant factor. It also examines the links between contemporary teaching and the beliefs and practices of English Catholic priests and women. The evidence suggests that traditional sexual theology has little relevance in the everyday lives of English Catholic priests and women. There is a lack of 'fit' between the traditional teaching of the Church and social experience. Nevertheless patriarchal ideas and beliefs continue to exist and have value, both in contemporary teaching and in the day-to-day life of the parish, and contribute to the contradictions and conflict of contemporary parish life. The discourses of English Catholic the priests and women in this study suggest, that both have been affected not only by the dominant discourse of the Church , but also by the critical discourses of the surrounding world. Views of women are emerging, which are in contrast to the negative view of women in Catholic sexual theology. The discourses of women and priests have much in common with each other but little in common with either traditional sexual theology or the teaching of the current pope. Together these discourses represent a significant point of resistance to the negative view of women in Catholic sexual theology and to traditional power and authority in the Catholic Church. A 'customary Priesthood' with an affinity to the 'customary Catholicism' of English Catholics appears to be emerging. This calls to question the legitimacy of traditional teaching and papal authority.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	265256	0
The development of the understanding of ministry in the Australian church union negotiations 1957-1971	 Dutney, Andrew Fergus	 University of St Andrews	 University of St Andrews	1985	Barely three years after the formation of the Uniting Church in Australia, the Assembly Standing Committee urged the Commission on Doctrine to 'give first priority to matters relating to ministry'. This urgent request was made in spite of the fact that questions concerning the understanding and ordering of ministry had been given close consideration during the twenty years of negotiation prior to union. In this paper we investigate the notion of 'ministry' as it was expressed in the Basis of Union, the foundation document of the UCA. A study of the development of the understanding of ministry during the period between the setting up of the Joint Commission on Church Union (1957) and the publication of their finally revised Basis of Union (1971) is required in order to substantiate the exposition of this understanding in the Basis. Accordingly, six aspects of the development are discussed. (i) An account is given of the evolution, during the decades prior to 1957, of the new perception of the ecumenical task in Australia with which the Commission began their work and which conditioned their development of an understanding of ministry. (ii) A detailed review and analysis of the Commission's two Reports (1959 and 1963) is conducted. (iii) The Commission's understanding is set in its wider context through a discussion of the convergence of missiological and ecclesiological thought between the Whitby Meeting of the IMC and the Mexico Conference of the DWME. (iv) The reception of the Commission's proposals is evaluated through a study of surviving published responses. (v) The Australian 'ecclesiastical climate' in the late sixties is assessed, and a theological response to that 'climate' is identified, as conditioning the Commission's revision of their proposals. (vi)The revised Basis of Union is analysed in detail. In conclusion, four characteristic emphases of the Basis are identified as determinative of the understanding of ministry in the Uniting Church in Australia.

 Negotiating the flow : an ethnographic study of the way two URC congregations shape and are shaped by members	 Russell, Jean Marion	 University of Birmingham	 University of Birmingham	2015	 This study was conducted with two congregations from two different joining denominations within the United Reformed Church in two post-industrial towns. I spent two years with each congregation as a participant observer, taking part in congregational life and interviewing members for a total of four years. My interest is in the activity that members of these congregations undertake to sustain and change their congregation’s identity. What particularly interested me was how a Reformed cultural identity was sustained, as there is no central body preserving the tradition. In tackling these issues, I explore the interplay of identity with location, community and worship. The recurring tensions drew my attention to the ways identity is renegotiated, which I explore further by engaging with the dynamic metaphor of flow and turbulence. I formulate a concept of belonging by modifying Foucault’s understanding of technology. I go on to explore the way that this technology of belonging is a driver of members’ interaction with the congregational identity. I therefore argue that congregational identity is a recapitulatory process, which engages the members’ understanding of themselves as belonging to the congregation. In doing this I demonstrate the unsettled, contraplex nature of members’ engagement with the congregation’s identity.

 The politics of gender in a time of change : gender discourses, institutions, and identities in contemporary Indonesia	 Love, Kaleen E.	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2008	 This dissertation fundamentally explores the nature of change, and the development interventions that aim to bring this change into a particular society. What emerges is the notion of a ‘spiral’: imagining the dynamic relationship between paradigms and discourses, the institutions and programmes operating in a place, and the way individual identities are constructed in intricate and contradictory ways. Within this spiral, discourse has power – ‘words matter’ – but equally significant is how these words interact dialogically with concrete social structures and institutions – ‘it takes more than changing words to change the world’. Furthermore, these changes are reacted to, and expressed in, the physical, sexed body. In essence, change is ideational, institutional, and embodied. To investigate the politics of change, this dissertation analyses the spiral relationships between gender discourses, institutions, and identities in contemporary Indonesia, focusing on their transmission across Java. It does so by exploring the Indonesian state’s gender policies in the context of globalisation, democratisation, and decentralisation. In this way, the lens of gender allows us to analyse the dynamic interactions between state and society, between ideas and institutions, which impact on everything from cultural structures to physical bodies. Research focuses on the gender policies of the Indonesian Ministry of Women’s Empowerment, substantiated with case study material from United Nations Population Fund reproductive health programmes in West Java. Employing a multi-level, multi-vocal theoretical framework, the thesis analyses gender discourses and relational structures (how discourses circulate to construct the Indonesian woman), gender institutions and social structures (how discourses are translated into programmes), and gender identities and embodied structures (how discourses enter the home and the body). Critically, studying gender requires analysing the human body as the site of both structural and symbolic power. This dissertation thus argues for renewed emphasis on a ‘politics of the body’, recognising that bodies are the material foundations from which gender discourses derive their naturalising power and hence ability to structure social relations. The danger of forgetting this politics of the body is that it allows for slippage between ‘gender’ and ‘women’; policy objectives cannot be disentangled from the reality of physical bodies and their social construction. This thesis therefore argues that there are distinct and even inverse impacts of gender policies in Indonesia. As the ‘liberal’ and ‘modern’ assumptions of gender equality are overlaid onto the patriarchal culture of a society undergoing transformation, women’s bodies and women’s sexuality are always and ever the focus of the social gaze. The gender policies and interventions affecting change on discursive and institutional levels may thus provoke reaction at the level of individual identities that are contrary to explicit intentions. In effect, projects that purport to work on ‘gender’ are often so deeply rooted in underlying gender normativity that their net effect is to reinscribe these gender hierarchies. By exposing the contradictions in these underlying paradigms we gain insight into the politics of a transforming society. Furthermore, engaging with the politics of the body allows us to analyse the spiral processes between discourse and practice, the question of power, and the way men and women embody social structures and experience social transformation.

 Holy living in an unholy world : the doctrine of the Christian life in the Book of Revelation	 Lowery, Robert Allen	 University of Aberdeen	 University of Aberdeen	1991	Using the inductive method of procedure, the dissertation will attempt to ascertain one thing: what is the nature of the Christian life in the Apocalypse? The following points will be argued: 1. A variety of literary techniques are used in exhorting Christians to the degree that the hortatory elements permeate the book. 2. Both the corporate nature of the people of God and individuals personally are emphasized. 3. The designations used to describe Christians provide insight into the self-consciousness of the people of God and how they are to express their status in daily living. They are the people of God constituted on the basis of the deed of Christ. The priestly service they render is unwavering faithfulness, the permanence of which grants them the seal of God's care and inclusion in the number of the saints. 4. With regard to vocation, performance of works and the practice of endurance dominate. The theme of faithfulness to the conquering Lamb runs, without exception, through their activities, for it is their activity which forms the necessary link between God and the world. 5. The attitudes and activities associated with the worship by Christians center about the figure of the Lamb. 6. Two conceptions, time and teleology, reveal that the ultimate destiny of creation is fulfilled in the Apocalypse by the faithful response of the believers to the call of God in Christ. The tension between the past and the future, the heavenly world and the world below, is finally resolved in the present task of the believers to be faithful witnesses. Through the power of language the Seer impressed upon his audience an awareness of the Christian life. It was a context in which Christians were called upon to choose between holy living or unholy living. There are no nuances in the Apocalypse.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	284322	0
 Anna Freud and education	 Dyer, Raymond	 University of Sheffield	 University of Sheffield	1980	This is a study of the central role of the child's ego in the educational process as seen through the life-work of the subject Anna Freud. A brief general introduction and survey of methods (Chapter 1) is followed by an outline of the historical emergence of an ego framework in twentieth-century child analytical science (Chapter 2). A detailed account with interpretative comment is then given (Chapters 3 to 7) on the biographical and professional background of our subject - Anna Freud - whose work has contributed massively to the field of ego psychology. Special consideration is given to ego defence and adaptation (Chapter 8) and to ego development (Chapter 9). The main educational implications of the subject's work are reviewed chronologically (Chapter 10) and this applied approach is then developed into a rigorously-based philosophy of teaching (Chapters 11 and 12). With regard to the 'essential thesis' of this work it is recommended as having the following three central themes: (i) to demonstrate Anna Freud as one of the great pedagogues of the twentieth century, (ii) to assert and substantiate a central role for the ego, and further for 'the personal and interpersonal' as the organising framework par excellence in child education and development, (iii) (ii) to justify and illustrate the potential role of fully practising teachers in establishing a middle ground' between on the one hand academic theorising upon, and on the other hand actual professional involvement in that complex and crucial human activity often referred to simply as 'Teaching'. Behind each of these may be detected a further theme,one altogether wider,more integrative and unifying. This - the quintessential thesis - concerns the power and efficacy of 'A Philosophy of The Middle Way and Its Practice', which is herein illustrated both in the external life and work of our subject and in the psychological role of the ego as mediator.

 Promoting the quality of life of elderly people in nursing home care : a hermeneutical approach	 Draper, Peter	 University of Hull	 University of Hull	1994	 The research described in this thesis addresses two central issues. The first issue concerns the development of a series of practice standards that will promote the quality of the lives of older people who live in nursing homes. However, before this professional issue is addressed, it is necessary to explore the meaning of the underlying concept the quality of life, and this constitutes the second issue.The purpose of this research is therefore to develop a concept of the quality of life that can adequately support a series of practice standards. The thesis is presented in five parts. Part one outlines the theoretical context of the study. It contains two chapters. The first discusses philosophical hermeneutics, which forms the conceptual and methodological framework of the research; and the second reviews aspects of the literature of the quality of life and evaluates it in terms of the purposes of the research. Part two of the thesis describes the empirical phase of the research, including the approach to data collection and the analytical strategy that was used. In part three the findings are presented, and in part four their implications are discussed for the organisation of care, and practice standards are derived. Part five evaluates the research, paying particular attention to the usefulness of philosophical hermeneutics, and suggestions are made for further research.

 The relationship between false memory and paranormal belief	 Greening, Emma Kate	 University of Hertfordshire	 University of Hertfordshire	2002	 The thesis investigates the effects of false memory and belief in the paranormal on reports of events. The first chapter reviews the existing literature on false memory. The main theories of how false memory develops are described and the individual differences of those susceptible to false memories are considered. The paranormal belief literature is then examined, particularly with regard to the cognitive differences between believers and disbelievers. It is concluded that these differences would be suggestive of a relationship between paranormal belief and false memory. The second chapter considers the relationship between imagination inflation, paranormal belief and ESP. No correlation between the factors was found. The third chapter examines whether pre-event suggestion and belief in the paranormal can affect experiences of `ghostly' phenomena in an allegedly haunted location. Evidence for the effect of belief in the paranormal was found, but there was no effect of pre-event suggestion or an interaction between the two factors. The fourth chapter investigates the effects of positive and negative during-event suggestion and paranormal belief on reports of events in the seance room, and the fifth chapter explores the effects of duringevent suggestion on reports of a key bending video. There was some evidence that during-event suggestion is effective in altering reports of events, and the causes for this effect are considered. Paranormal belief was not shown to consistently affect acceptance of suggestion, but may affect reports of phenomena which are judged to be paranormal. The thesis concludes that during-event suggestion and negative suggestion are areas which offer great potential for further research. The relationship between paranormal belief and false memory development has not been demonstrated. However, it has been shown that belief and suggestion can affect the manner in which situations are attended to and interpreted.

 The kinetics, kinematics and energy requirements of distance running : implications for footwear design	 Sinclair, Jonathan	 University of Central Lancashire	 University of Central Lancashire	2012	As the primary interface between the runner and the road, athletic footwear has a potentially important role to play in the reduction/management of chronic injuries and enhancement of performance. Over the past thirty years the running shoe has changed considerably. However, despite significant advances in footwear technology, the incidence of injury in distance runners has not altered meaningfully. It has been postulated that poor footwear selection is the mechanism behind this, whereby running shoes are incorrectly selected/inappropriate for the populations and situations in which they are worn. The investigations and results obtained from this thesis aim to attenuate this, and provide runners and footwear manuafacturers with new knowledge regarding the application of footwear to different populations and conditions in order to improve both injury occurence and performance. In addition to a significant amount of developmental analyses, four principal examinations were conducted as part of this thesis. Study 1 aimed to determine the kinetic and 3-D kinematic differences between treadmill and overground running, in order to determine whether the treadmill replicates overground running and whether different footwear is necessary during treadmill running. It was observed specifically that treadmill running was associated with significant increases in eversion and tibial internal rotation whilst overground runners exhibited greater peak tibial accelerations. It was concluded that treadmill runners are likely to require footwear with additional medial stability properties, aimed at reducing rearfoot eversion whilst overground runners should consider footwear with more advanced midsole cushioning properties designed to reduce the magnitude of impact transients. Study 2 examined the gender differences in the kinetics and 3-D kinematics of running in order to determine whether females require running shoes specifically tailored to their running mechanics. Females were associated with significant increases in eversion and tibial internal rotation; reaffirming the notion that they are more susceptible to overuse injuries than males. It is reccommended that females select running footwear with design characteristics aimed towards the reduction of rearfoot eversion in order to reduce the incidence of injury. Study 3 investigated the kinetics and 3-D kinematics of running: barefoot, in conventional running shoes and in barefoot inspired footwear in order to determine the efficacy of barefoot running in comparison to shod and also the ability of barefoot inspired footwear to closely mimic the 3-D kinematics of barefoot running. Barefoot running was associated with significant increases in impact parameters. It was also observed that barefoot inspired footwear does not closely mimic the 3-D kinematics of barefoot running. This leads to the final conclusion that barefoot running may not serve to reduce the incidence of injury. Study 4 aimed to examine the influence of footwear with different shock attenuating properties on the energy requirments of distance running and to investigate the biomechanical parameters which have the stongest association with running economy using regression analyses. Whilst footwear with different shock attenuating properties did not influence running economy, it was observed that a significant proportion of the variance in running economy could be explained by kinematic and EMG parameters. The thesis has provided information not previously available regarding the injury prevention and performance aspects of running footwear. It is clear that footwear cannot be universally prescribed and that the population and circumstances in which different shoes are used are key when selecting and designing appropriate running footwear.

 Strange devices on the Jacobean stage : image, spectacle, and the materialisation of morality	 Davies, Callan John	 University of Exeter	 University of Exeter	2015	Concentrating on six plays in the 1610s, this thesis explores the ways theatrical visual effects described as “strange” channel the period’s moral anxieties about rhetoric, technology, and scepticism. It contributes to debates in repertory studies, textual and material culture, intellectual history, theatre history, and to recent revisionist considerations of spectacle. I argue that “strange” spectacle has its roots in the materialisation of morality: the presentation of moral ideas not as abstract concepts but in physical things. The first part of my PhD is a detailed study of early modern moral philosophy, scepticism, and material and textual culture. The second part of my thesis concentrates on Shakespeare’s Cymbeline (1609-10) and The Tempest (1611), John Webster’s The White Devil (1612), and Thomas Heywood’s first three Age plays (1611-13). These spectacular plays are all written and performed within the years 1610-13, a period in which the changes, challenges, and developments in both stage technology and moral philosophy are at their peak. I set these plays in the context of the wider historical moment, showing that the idiosyncrasy of their “strange” stagecraft reflects the period’s interest in materialisation and its attendant moral anxieties. This thesis implicitly challenges some of the conclusions of repertory studies, which sometimes threatens to hierarchise early modern theatre companies by seeing repertories as indications of audience taste and making too strong a divide between, say, “elite” indoor and “citizen” outdoor playhouses. It is also aligned with recent revisionist considerations of spectacle, and I elide divisions in criticism between interest in original performance conditions, close textual analysis, or historical-contextual readings. I present “strangeness” as a model for appreciating the distinct aesthetic of these plays, by reading them as part of their cultural milieu and the material conditions of their original performance.

 From Rhodesia to Zimbabwe via Oxford and London : a study of the career of Dambudzo Marechera	 Pattison, David	 University of Hull	 University of Hull	1998	 [From the introduction] : In my first chapter I will offer a review of Marechera's reputation and the critical reception given to his work, both during his life and since his death. In Chapter Two I Will outline the major theoretical issues raised by Marechera's work: Art versus psychological catharsis; the artist-as-communal-spokesman versus the artist-as-Romantic-individualist; nationalism versus literary universalism. Chapters Three, Four, Five and Six will then consider in sequence, the work produced in Oxford, in London and in Harare, tracing the writer's physical and psychological deterioration through his evolving prose style. Each of these chapters will also focus on a major relevant critical issue. Thus Chapter Three will examine The House of Hunger, written following Marechera's arrival in Oxford, in the context of 'culture clash', 'the African heritage' and Postcolonialism which so preoccupied its original reviewers. Chapter Four will examine Black Sunlight and The Black Insider, written while the author was destitute in London, in terms of Jung's 'neurosis or art' debate. Chapter Five will examine Mindblast and Chapter Six will examine Scrapiron Blues, both containing material written after Marecheras' return to Harare, making reference to the historical and socio-political context of post-colonial Zimbabwe and to the writer's unsuccessful attempts to establish a role with the nation builders. I will conclude in Chapter Seven by discussing Marechera's place within the Zimbabwean literary canon, the current relevance and influence of his work and the implications this holds for the future of Zimbabwean writing.

 'Out to an other side' : the poetry of Paul Celan and Seamus Heaney and the poetic challenge to post-modern discussions of absence and presence in the context of theological and philosophical conceptions of language and artistic production	 Coyle, Derek	 University of Glasgow	 University of Glasgow	2002	Martin Heidegger in 'The Origin of the Work of Art' seeks to approach the self-subsistent nature of art. The Greek Temple opens up a space within which our Being may dwell. It is the site of human civilization and religion, and of our capacity to dwell within abstractions like peace, justice, truth and representation. Art breaks open a new place and presents things in a fresh light. Language is the primary model for this activity. Paul Celan in his poetry offers a challenge to Heideggerian abstraction. Both poet and philosopher were intimately familiar with each other's work, yet there is no essay on Celan, or even a reference, in the entire Heideggerian corpus. Celan's poem 'The Straitening' conveys the breakdown of meaning that has occurred after the holocaust. In form and content it challenges any Heideggerian notion of the higher univocity achieved by great poetry. We will explore recent examples of how poets have examined the idea of cultural belonging exclusion. We present a distillation of this idea in the writings of Paul Celan, particularly his presentation of the moment of 'Shibboleth'. We explore the biblical origin of the term 'Shibboleth' in a conflict between the army of Jephtah and the Ephraimites. We look at a contemporary poem with 'shibboleth' as it theme. Seamus Heaney's 'Broagh'. A consistent theme of Maurice Blanchot's critical reflection from The Work of Fire in 1949 up to and including The Space of Literature in 1955, is the manner in which our being creatures unto death allows us to create art, and to think and write in the abstraction that is language. Life endures death and maintains itself in it. For Blanchot Rainer Maria Rilke is one of the most significant modern poets in the way in which he has presented and explored this theme. We challenge Blanchot's inadequate reading of Rilke in The Space of Literature as an instance of his own pre-conceived philosophical nihilism.

Opening the cognitive tool-box of migrating sculptors (1680-1794) : an analysis of the epistemic and semiotic structures of the republic of tools	 Seyler, Katrin Jutta	 University of Birmingham	 University of Birmingham	2012	This thesis explores the epistemic structures of late seventeenth- and eighteenth-century migrating image-makers with a particular regard for producers of sculpture. By means of an analysis of journals written by the sculptor Franz Ertinger (1669 – 1747) and the glazier Jacques-Louis Ménétra (1738-c.1803) this thesis identifies an epistemic order which was contingent on the worlds of mobility of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century craftsmen. In order to advance the understanding of how artisan image-makers of this period acquired, organised and developed knowledge, the concept of a cognitive tool-box is introduced. Examining a number of cognitive tools, i. e. epistemic strategies, the thesis constructs an interpretative framework through which itinerant artisans were potentially able to derive meanings from situations, objects and communities which were unfamiliar or culturally different in some ways. Due to the emphasis on cognitive aspects, the thesis‟s principal method can be described as an epistemological history of art, taking into consideration historically specific mechanisms of interpretation, exchange and knowledge organisation, such as the building of unwritten archives of artisan histories. The thesis also addresses questions surrounding the identities of migrating craftsmen and suggests the existence of a “Republic of Tools”, tracing the career of one of its highly mobile citizens, the sculptor Johann Eckstein (1735-1817).

 A pure world : moral cognition and spiritual experiences in Chinese World of Warcraft	 Hornbeck, Ryan	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2012	This dissertation is about moral cognition and the production of spiritual experiences in the Chinese version of the massively multiplayer online game, World of Warcraft (CWoW). Chapter 1 introduces the game, field sites, data collection methods, and the questions and paradigms that structure the dissertation's narrative. This chapter explains that during fieldwork CWoW players frequently described gameplay as yielding positive moral and spiritual experiences. Chapter 2 outlines the cognitive mechanisms – Haidt and Joseph's 'moral foundations' (2004; 2007) – that are hypothesised to inform the in-game experiences to which players attributed moral significance. Chapter 3 argues that some aspects of the WoW gameworld are high in cognitive 'relevance' (following Sperber	 Thesis or dissertation	 Psychology ; Cognition ; Social psychology ; Philosophy of mind ; Anthropology ; Moral cognition ; spiritual experiences ; World of Warcraft ; China	600630	0
 Measurement of income inequality in Mexico : methodology, assessment and empirical relationship with poverty and human development	 Vazquez-Guzman, David	 University of Stirling	 University of Stirling	2008	The intended contribution of this work is to systematically discuss a selection of methodological topics and some of the empirical and technical issues that have been driving the measurement of inequality in Mexico so far. This discussion has two strands: firstly, the general case, and second, the particular case of Mexico. The general case include some philosophical concerns, along with a review of the traditional inequality measurement, the most common operational decisions in empirical calculations, and the recent methodological contribution of development literature that is mostly centered around the capability approach of Sen (1985b). The philosophical part contrasted with other approaches and rejected the Marxist view of economic inequality, which is mostly viewed as an outcome of exploitation. The distributional judgments are compared with more ancient schools of thought in regards to justice. Another methodological issue is such that social inequality, approximated by income inequality, might be considered as an additional functioning that measures the degree of social cohesion in the country, this finding is an implication that comes from the definition of functionings within the capability approach; then, social inequality is a functioning that is different in nature from other measures of destitution, and it is also different from the destitution that is captured by absolute poverty measurement. Our general case includes a review of the most popular ways to measure inequality, such as normative and pragmatic inequality measures that are mentioned with their properties, with their rankings of the distributions provided by the use of stochastic dominance and quantile comparisons, and the construction of statistical models and some graphic representations of income economic inequality; the approach of inequality concerns included in the measurement of relative poverty is rejected for the sake of clarity. Then this general view would guide us to a better understanding of the Mexican literature for the consideration of income distribution. The measurement of destitution provided by governmental offices is necessary to discuss, because there might be some lack of coherence between the design of the measurement and the complex legal system in Mexico. We also consider a set of regulatory concerns that might not be unique to the Mexican law, but may be generalized for developing countries as a whole. Some of the methodological discussions that show how the Mexican research has been influenced by the international literature about human destitution will be good to clarify, looking at the value judgments that have been automatically accepted by the researchers. A sensitivity analysis was performed to the empirical calculation of inequality in Mexico, so the measurement showed to be different in regards to a variety of operational concerns: the recipient unit, the different data from income and consumption-expenditure surveys, various non-responses and underreported biases, the inclusion of a regional price index, among other things. In this work was also covered the reasons why it might be the case that destitution and poverty assessment was studied more deeply than inequality itself, so the possible ambiguity of inequality with poverty measurement is challenged in this work with a variety of theoretical remarks and empirical arguments. The final topic for the particular case of Mexico is to shed light in regards to the context of the capability approach and the use of equivalence scales, because these methodological approaches consider respectively directly and indirectly the assessment of distributional judgments. This discussion is followed by an empirical assessment of inequality measures that is related with a set of functionings and services, where a direct relationship of measures of inequality with other measures of destitution is made clear.

 The genre of the Book of Revelation from a source-critical perspective	 Mazzaferri, Frederick David	 University of Aberdeen	 University of Aberdeen	1986	 This is a small contribution to the current debate regarding the genre of the Book of Revelation. The study is motivated by the observation that John employs prolific sources both uniquely and generically. The results of prior source-critical studies are employed to delineate the scope and nature of John's sources. The specific source-critical contribution of this study is a detailed analysis of the manner in which John employs his sources with generic intent. However, the analysis is conducted in strict compliance with the dictates of the principles of generic criticism. For convenience, these principles and those of source criticism are not discussed until just prior to the generic analysis of Rev itself. But the initial chapters assume the principles to lay the necessary groundwork. A study of authorship and unity indicates that Rev is a unified whole, the work of a single author. Source criticism may therefore be confined alone to John's prolific allusions and punctiliar quotations. Generic definitions are deduced for classical OT prophecy and classical apocalyptic in turn. However, available data is far too sparse to permit similar results for NT prophecy or neo-apocalyptic. Accordingly, only the first two have any possible generic claim upon Rev. In strict generic terms Rev fails to qualify as classical apocalyptic, as indicated as well by source criticism. Generically, Rev also fails to qualify as classical prophecy. However, generic and source criticism concur that John makes strenuous efforts to match this paradigm, and falls only marginally short. He is certainly a neo-classical prophet, albeit with no generic companions. He dips his hands in several diverse families of sources. But he bathes himself in classical OT prophecy alone.

 On secularisation : structural, institutional and cultural determinants shaping individual secularisation	 Müller, Tim Sven	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2012	This thesis deals with the determinants and mechanisms of individual secularisation processes in a cross-national perspective. In this ‘collected volume’ of six stand-alone articles, I examine religious beliefs and behaviours as well as attitudes towards religion and politics, whereby the validity of the main theories of religious change (classical secularisation theory, existential security hypothesis, supply-side explanations, historical/cultural approaches and conflict theories) are put to an empirical test. The main conclusion is that the fundamental mechanisms suggested by secularisation theories are valid and that we can identify main determinants of religiosity worldwide. However, only a combination of existing approaches is capable of explaining a broad range of the phenomena observed. Chapter 1 (co-authored with Nan Dirk de Graaf and Peter Schmidt) deals with the fundamental mechanisms that facilitate the socialisation of religious beliefs. Under conditions of high inequality, religion acts as a source of social capital that benefits the religious socialisation of individuals outside of the family context. If levels of inequality fall, this ‘social value of religion’ is diminished and religious socialisation depends more strongly on parental efforts, thereby gradually leading to intergenerational secularisation. In Chapter 2 (co-authored with Anja Neundorf) we show that the state in Eastern Europe played a crucial role in de-establishing as well as re-establishing religious plausibility structures, which explains lower levels of religious belief in Cold War cohorts as well as the religious revival after the end of the Cold War. Chapters 3 and 4 examine the topic of religion and politics and the mechanisms behind the support for the 9/11 attacks in the Muslim world. Levels of existential security and income inequality have a strong impact on the preferences for religious politicians in a cross-sectional as well as in a longitudinal perspective. Moreover, religiosity and altruistic behaviour run the risk of being converted into pro-terrorist support under conditions of high levels of inequality and low development levels. The final two chapters show that –in a world-wide comparison development levels, inequality and the Socialist history of countries explain 75% of the variation in religiosity between countries. Furthermore, future developments in religious change will also be subject to changes in fertility. The main drivers of secularisation processes can be identified, but for the majority of the world population these conditions are not met at present, nor will they be met in the near future.

 David Williams' Lessons to a young prince : publisher influence and reader response	 Robinson, Peter	 University of Sussex	 University of Sussex	2013	This thesis presents an interpretation of David Williams' (1738-1816) Lessons to a young prince (1790) ostensibly from a publisher-centric viewpoint. Through close analysis of its English-language editions it argues that Lessons has been consistently misattributed, misread, and otherwise taken out of context. The agglomeration of both contextual and particular factors contributed to this general negligence, but the most important factors were anonymity and the transformation of the text by the addition of a tenth lesson on Edmund Burke's Reflections, which altered the way Lessons was read by contemporaries in light of the revolution controversy. The thesis suggests that the explicit ad-hominen attack on Burke in the tenth lesson overshadowed what amounted to an implicit attack on Burke-in-transition towards Reflections contained in the original nine lessons. Using a significant body of previously unknown material to identify Williams' intended audience and the effects of anonymity, genre, and advertising on reader-response to Lessons, the thesis adds to existing knowledge about Williams' intentions and to the way his texts were read and understood by contemporaries. More particularly it underscores the importance of his publishers and charts their impact upon his text. The influence that Lessons' publishers had on the impact of the text, both intentional and unintentional had received no scholarly attention, and they are themselves, as publishers, understudied. However, as this thesis shows, their direct textual interpolations increased the satirical vigour of Lessons, whilst a sophisticated marketing campaign attempted to influence reader reception as well as sales. Indirectly, anonymity caused readers to superimpose the political sympathies of the publishers onto Lessons, which further pre-ordained the terms on which they were read.

The descent of Christ in Ephesians 4:7-11 : an exegetical investigation with special reference to the influence of traditions about Moses associated with Psalm 68:19	 Harris, Walker Hall	 University of Sheffield	 University of Sheffield	1989	This study attempts to demonstrate that the most probable interpretation of the descent of Christ in Eph. 4: 7-11 involves a descent of Christ as the Spirit who distributes gifts to his church subsequent to the ascent of Eph. 4: 8. The investigation begins with a history of the interpretation of Eph. 4: 7-11. Most modern interpreters favour either a descent to the under- world (or the grave) between Christ's death and resurrection or a descent from heaven to earth at the incarnation. Textual and grammatical problems relevant to the proposed exegesis are also discussed. A major portion of the study deals with the ascent-descent imagery associating Ps. 68: 19 (quoted in Eph. 4: 8) and Moses as found in Tg Psalms and the rabbinic literature. The author of Ephesians, had he been aware of these traditions associating Psalm 68 with Moses, would have been predisposed to think in terms of a subsequent descent, because Moses' ascent of Mt Sinai to receive the Torah was followed by his descent to distribute it as 'gifts' to men. Although it is clear that both Tg Psalms and the rabbinic literature are later than Ephesians, there is evidence from a number of early sources that such Moses-traditions were in circulation prior to the first century CE. The association of these traditions with Ps. 68: 19 as employed by the author of Ephesians appears to exist through the connection of Moses' ascent of Sinai to receive the Torah with the celebration of the Jewish feast of Pentecost on the one hand, and the Christian use of Psalm 68 in connection with Pentecost (described in Acts 2) on the other. Ps. 68: 19 was already understood to refer to the ascent of Christ and the gift of the Spirit in a layer of tradition older than Ephesians. Familiarity with the Moses-traditions connected with an ascent and descent of Sinai would have suggested a subsequent descent. Thus the author's innovation did not lie in the use of the psalm in a christological sense, nor in the introduction of a subsequent descent of Christ inferred from the ascent mentioned in Ps. 68: 19. The contribution of the author of Ephesians consisted in his identification of the ascended Christ as the Spirit who descended to distribute gifts to his church. Such an interpretation offers the best explanation of the passage in light of the evidence linking Moses-traditions of a heavenly ascent at Sinai with Pentecost and Psalm 68.

 Critical systems thinking and social systemic transformation in Malawi	 Mvula, Aubrey Harry	 University of Hull	 University of Hull	1999	 This thesis considers whether critical systems thinking (CST) may assist with social transformation in Malawi, a largely pre-modem and poverty stricken Third World nation. In the process, which must include modernisation, the country's public services appear to be the most viable catalyst and are, therefore, the focus of this research. However, the services are fraught with multiple interlocking problems, most of which emanate from the fact that public services are inextricably connected to a forbidding context and reality in which they work. Most of the problems are cultural and historical. It is argued in this thesis that the most significanteffect of theforbidding context is in the area of the cognitive development of Malawi's people, including the public servants. Colonial socialisation, State political domination and suppression of social discourse, absence of a democratic ethos in governance and society, lack of investment and fluidity have over the centuries impoverished the context, which is also Malawi's social framework of knowledge. This has hampered the cognitive development of a huge majority of Malawians, and prevented progress in socio-political development. It has also interlocked with other problems to reproduce this reality. The other problems include those of language, deep poverty, wide spread ignorance and illiteracy, ethnic division and lack of opportunity for the majority; lack of socio-economic resources, sub-optimal management, low productivity and paucity of oppositional thinking. It is argued that, in its present form, CST is inadequate for the task of intervening in such a forbidding situation and dealing anywhere near adequately with it. This thesis observes the following as major problems with CST: an inappropriate philosophical grounding, confusion between the ontological order and the epistemic order, lack of appropriate approaches to social reality and inadequacy of theory. The thesis narrates a brief history and development of systems thinking and traces the emergence of CST, which it tests. The initial critical intents of CST are examined together with the philosophy underpinning it, exposing its limitations. Critical realism, represented by the works of Roy Bhaskar, is examined for its suitabilityas new philosophy for science and CST. It is found to be appropriate and is endorsed. Implications for this are considered. This helps to resolve the confusion between the ontological order and the epistemic order in CST and leads to CST's new configuration based on critical realism as the enabling critical framework/meta-theory.Following these gains, a more appropriate approach to social reality is elaborated for CST. The approach projects for CST the basis of a materialistic and science-based method for intervening and achieving social transformation in that context and possibly similar others. It recognises that social structures are activitydependent, concept-dependent, time-space-dependent and social-relation-dependent, and that human activity is dependent on given materials (means, media, resources, and rules), which it transforms. It also recognises that society is the condition of human agency and that human agency is equally a condition for society, which, in continuity, it reproduces and/or transforms. Working with this belief, the thesis explores new material and proposes a theory of development relevant for Malawi, and capable of addressing significantly, the problem of inadequacy of theory in CST. The theory proposed concerns human socialisation and efficacious agency; and directionality of transition, politics of, and limits to social transformation in a society such as Malawi. The utility of this theory has been examined theoretically in this thesis and against findings of field empirical investigations and critical realist analyses thereof. Ideas for methods for a CST intervention in the forbidding context in Malawi are also proposed from there. Additionally, this thesis shows how political thought and action are legitimate social systemic forms of endeavour that need to be included in CST if it is to make any significant impact in coercive contexts. This is considered within a conception of CST in a permanent dialectical relationship between itself as social science and society as the social object that it seeks to deal with and transform. In this relationship, CST is seen as involved and interested in the way social reality must be like and taking an active part in its transformation.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	484226	0

 The role of music and musicians in current English parish church worship : the attitudes of clergy and organists	 Rees, Robin Lodowick Douglas	 University of Sheffield	 University of Sheffield	1990	One of the many issues currently confronting the Church of England is the role of music in worship. It is not a new debate, but has been brought into sharper focus in recent years in the wake of liturgical change. After examining the fundamental issues of the debate, the author considers them in the context of the present day. Other current matters of concern will also be discussed. The effects of liturgical change are then considered. The discussion is then widened to include: - a review of current hymnals and psalters; - a survey of the courses and qualifications in church music available in Great Britain; - three case studies demonstrating the problems that can arise when clergy and church musicians are in conflict; - a review of surveys in church music undertaken since 1950. The main work comprises a detailed survey by questionnaire to the priest-in-charge and organist at almost half the churches in a large diocese (that of Oxford). This yields an overall picture of: - respondents' personal backgrounds and general attitudes; - respondents' perceptions, both objective and subjective, of the situation at their church, and of each other. From these varied strands are drawn certain conclusions for improving clergy-organist relationships, and suggestions for further research in the subject.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Philosophy	283902	0

 Understanding object-directed intentionality in Capuchin monkeys and humans	 Tao, Ruoting	 University of St Andrews	 University of St Andrews	2016	Understanding intentionality, i.e. coding the object directedness of agents towards objects, is a fundamental component of Theory of Mind abilities. Yet it is unclear how it is perceived and coded in different species. In this thesis, we present a series of comparative studies to explore human adults' and Capuchin monkeys' ability to infer intentional objects from actions. First we studied whether capuchin monkeys and adult humans infer a potential object from observing an object-directed action. With no direct information about the goal-object, neither species inferred the object from the action. However, when the object was revealed, the monkeys retrospectively encoded the directedness of the object-directed action; unexpectedly, in an adapted version of the task adult humans did not show a similar ability. We then adapted another paradigm, originally designed by Kovács et al (2010), to examine whether the two species implicitly register the intentional relation between an agent and an object. We manipulated an animated agent and the participants' belief about a ball's presence behind a hiding screen. We found no evidence showing that humans or monkeys coded object-directedness or belief. More importantly, we failed to replicate the original results from Kovács et al's study, and through a series of follow up studies, we questioned their conclusions regarding implicit ToM understanding. We suggested that, instead of implicit ToM, results like Kovacs et al's might be interpreted as driven by “sub-mentalizing” processes, as suggested by Heyes (2014). We conclude that so called ‘implicit ToM' may be based upon the computation of intentional relations between perceived agents and objects. But, these computations might present limitations, and some results attributed to implicit ToM may in fact reflect “sub-mentalizing” processes.

 A critical comparative study of pastoral care provision for the elderly in Britain, and its implications for contextualization in Ghana : an inter-cultural study with focus on selected mainline churches	 Ayete-Nyampong, Samuel	 University of Aberdeen	 University of Aberdeen	1997	 Ageing---its problems and potentialities---is an issue of discussion, research and social policy in many developed and developing countries. In Ghana (as well as in many African States), the realisation of the problems of ageing is emerging as a result of the social changes that have weakened the traditional support system and plunged the once respected, venerated and cared-for elderly people into difficulties relating to their status, potential value and well-being within the new Ghanaian society. Christianity has pioneered many developments in Ghana, and has also been a contributor to the present social changes. This study is therefore an attempt to address the problems of ageing people in Ghana from a Christian pastoral care perspective in the hope of creating awareness at both statutory and non-statutory levels of the need to develop alternative support systems to enhance the status and well-being of the elderly in Ghanaian society. The studies thus involved a survey of pastoral care practices in the Church of Scotland, the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church (in England and Scotland) and the contexualisation of some of these pastoral care programmes in the Ghanaian situation. In studying the churches it became evident that there are various methods of pastoral care employed by denominations and within congregations for elderly people. These include research publications and discussions on ageing at national level, residential care, diocesan and parish programmes such as community awareness and support schemes, parish level luncheons, coffee mornings, day care and the church fellowship within the Christian communities which enable elderly people to participate in service to one another and to the Church.

 The link between business strategy, human resource management and business performance : the case of the Greek manufacturing sector	 Katou, Anastasia	 Cardiff University	 University of Wales	2004	The purpose of this study is to develop an understanding of the processes by which business strategies and HRM policies are related with business performance. Using a sample of 178 organisations operating in the Greek manufacturing sector. I investigated the universalistic model focusing on the extent to which HRM policies are used in the Greek manufacturing organisations and the contingency model focusing on the moderating effect of business strategy on the HRM-performance relationship. Furthermore, I examined the impact of HRM systems (resourcing-development and reward-relations) on business performance mediated by employee skills (competent and cooperated), attitudes (motivation, commitment, satisfaction), and behaviours (turnover. absenteeism) in an attempt to investigate the so-called "black-box" through which HRM systems lead to business performance. The results show strong support for the universalistic model, indicating that the HRM policies of recruitment, training, promotion, incentives, benefits, involvement, and health and safety are positively related with organisational performance, and the HRM pol icies of recruitment, job evaluation, promotion, and health and safety are positively related with financial performance. Moreover, the results show some support for the contingency model, indicating that the HRM systems of resourcing-development and reward-relations are either universally applicable or they are contingent on the business strategies of quality, innovation and cost, according to the specific organisational performance variable (effectiveness, efficiency, development, satisfaction, innovation, quality), or the specific financial performance variable (return on equity, return on capital employed), are called to predict. Finally the results support the concept that the HRM outcomes of employee skills, attitudes and behaviours play a mediating role between HRM systems and business performance, and generally in a framework linking HRM systems and financial performance, any theory of linkages should explicitly recognise all major links from the initial till the final step, otherwise the results may be erroneous.

 Iodine speciation in marine aerosol	 Yodle, Chan	 University of East Anglia	 University of East Anglia	2015	Iodine chemistry in the marine aerosol plays important roles in the marine boundary layer such as ozone destruction and new aerosol particle formation. Iodine has a complex chemistry in the gas and aerosol phases and to date, what controls iodine speciation, the interactions and roles of individual iodine species are not well understood. This research aims to identify key controls on iodine speciation in marine aerosol. Effects of filter types on iodine and extraction methods were tested to provide optimum conditions for extraction of iodine species. Coupling of ion chromatography and inductively coupled plasma – mass spectrometry (IC-ICP-MS) for the measurement of iodine speciation was developed to provide a reliable analytical method. These optimised methods were used to determine iodine speciation in samples collected during cruises in the Atlantic Ocean (AMT21) and the Pacific Ocean (TransBrom and SHIVA). Major ions were also determined in these samples by ion chromatography (IC) with the results providing insight into the chemical characteristics aerosol samples. A high variability of the total soluble iodine (TSI) was observed between AMT21 (12–82, median 30 pmol m-3) and TransBrom (1.6–27, median 6.9 pmol m-3) and SHIVA (5.9–15, median 8.4 pmol m-3). The proportions of iodide (I-), iodate (IO3-) and soluble organic iodine (SOI) on the three cruises also showed a high variability: AMT21: I- 5.2–39%, median 14%; IO3- 36–99%, median 66%; and SOI 13–47%, median 28%, TransBrom: I- 8.8–64%, median 46%; IO3- 1.8–65%, median 6.2%; and SOI 5.9–50%, median 39%, SHIVA: I- 22–79%, median 42%; IO3- 17–66%, median 39%; and SOI non-determinable value–41%, median 14%. Three main types of aerosol with distinctive iodine speciation were identified: polluted aerosol, clean seasalt and mineral dust. pH seems to play an important role in regulating iodine speciation. The formation of HOI and the reduction of iodate are driven by acidic conditions in polluted aerosol. In clean less acidic seasalt aerosol, a high iodine enrichment was observed (565–1675, median 725), especially in the fine mode aerosol. For mineral dust, uptake of HIO3 on calcium carbonate surfaces seems to dominate.	 Thesis or dissertation	577	679150	0
 Modelling of impaired system performance in burst mode optical networks	 Desai, Priyanka	 University of Nottingham	 University of Nottingham	2012	All-optical regeneration and optical packet/burst switching (OPS/OBS) are two potential key enabling technologies for the on-going development of all optical networks. OPS/OBS is required to deal with the bursty nature of Internet Protocol packets which are currently electrically packet switched and optical regenerators are necessary for signal quality improvement irrespective whether the system deals with a continuous data stream or packets/bursts. Thus, the work presented in this thesis focuses on 2R burst mode optical regenerators and their cascadeability. Firstly a system level model for the 2R burst mode optical regenerator (BMOR) cascade is provided. An optical limiting amplifier and optical reshaper are defined within the BMOR model. The limiting amplifier is the distinctive feature of BMOR (relative to continuous mode) and deals with the issues of handling incoming packet with the varying power levels. The 2R BMOR cascade model is then used to investigate the ASE noise evolution, and BER performance, in both homogenous and heterogeneous inter-regenerator amplifier cascades. The capability of the limiting amplifiers to adapt with the change in power packet/bursts is shown. The ASE noise accumulation in the mark and space probability density functions and suppression of ASE noise performed by the cascade of BMOR is observed. In addition, the reduction in the BER degradation along the cascade due to the presence of BMOR in the system is also shown. The impact of phase uncorrelated co-channel homodyne and heterodyne (interferometric) crosstalk on the ASE noise redistribution in a 2R BMOR cascade is further investigated. The impact of the interferometric crosstalk on the signal and ASE noise leading to the widening of the mark and space pdfs is studied. The suppression of interferometric crosstalk performed by the 2R BMOR cascades is shown. BER eva1uation is provided along the 2R burst mode regenerator cascade for different crosstalk scenarios in a homogenous and heterogeneous inter-regenerator amplifier cascade. Not only is this work the first inclusion of interferometric crosstalk in 2R BMOR cascades known to the author hut also much of it is transferable to the continuous mode 2R OR case where only very limited investigation has occurred. Furthermore, a FSO optical amplifier cascade is proposed and investigated, firstly in its own right (not least as the optical amplifiers may have regenerator like properties, when operated in gain saturation mode which leads to scintillation suppression) and secondly for application in the 2R BMOR cascade, as a substitute to part of the fibre based inter-regenerator cascade. Additionally, the FSO amplifier cascade can be used as a backup for fibre in continuous as well as packet/burst mode systems. The improvement in the system's performance impaired by scintillations due to atmospheric turbulence is investigated. An average BER and outage analysis for the scintillation impaired system's performance is provided, using a Monte Carlo simulation to model the atmospheric turbulent channel. Further, scintillation suppression can be achieved which is similar to the 2R regeneration process.	 Thesis or dissertation	621.3827	594396	0
 Workplace social capital, job satisfaction and workplace performance in developed and developing countries	 Femina, Devi	 University of Manchester	 University of Manchester	2016	Although social capital had been found to solve collective action problems, social capital at work or workplace social capital has only recently begun to be researched. This is noteworthy given that most of our waking hours are spent in the workplace. While workplace social capital is suggested to improve workplace performance, job satisfaction had been found to improve workplace performance. However, workplace social capital and job satisfaction have never been examined together with regard to workplace performance. Furthermore, most studies on workplace performance have focused on developed countries with evidence from developing countries is lacking. The aims of this thesis were to investigate 1) whether workplace social capital affects job satisfaction; 2) the relationship of social capital, job satisfaction and workplace performance; 3) whether individual characteristics differ in determining job satisfaction in developed and developing countries; and 4) whether context of organisations in developed and developing countries differ in determining the relationship of social capital, job satisfaction and workplace performance. To achieve those aims, this thesis selects two sets of secondary data representing developed countries: EWCS2010 in Europe combining workers with their regions and countries and WERS2011 in Britain linking workers to their workplaces; while primary data froma developing country have been gathered from public hospitals in Indonesia associating workers with workplaces. As such, this thesis exploits two approaches using structural equation modelling in multilevel models. First, the customary Macro-micro approach is used to examine the relationship between workplace social capital and job satisfaction treating both variables as latent constructs. Second, the less common micro-Macro approach is exercised to investigate the relationship between workplace social capital, job satisfaction and workplace performance. Results from developed countries show that workplace social capital is positively associated with individual outcomes such as job satisfaction and well-being even in times of financial crisis. Comparing the results between developed and developing countries, workplace social capital is positively significantly associated with job satisfaction in Britain and in Indonesia. With regard to higher level outcomes, workplace social capital is associated with better financial performance, while job satisfaction is associated with higher quality in British general industry. Turning to results from Indonesia, workplace social capital is associated with lower expenditure per bed; job satisfaction, however, failed to be associated with any workplace performance measures. Several individual and workplace characteristics in both developed and developing countries have similar influences on job satisfaction and workplace performance. Nevertheless, there are some contrasting results regarding the influence of those characteristics in developed and developing countries.

 Practice and outcomes for radical urological cancer surgery in England : a study based on hospital episode statistics and a review of the literature	 Nuttall, Martin Chandler	 University College London (University of London)	 UCL (University College London)	2006	Complete, timely and accurate data are needed to monitor the quality of surgical care in the UK. However, large-scale national audits are labour-intensive and expensive. Furthermore, within surgery many studies have noted wide variation between post operative outcomes amongst hospitals. Studies have also tried to determine whether the number of cases performed at a hospital is one component that can influence surgical outcomes. With this in mind, the overall aims of this thesis were to describe the practice and outcomes for radical urological cancer surgery in England, and to determine whether the number (or 'volume') of procedures that a hospital carries out is a potential determinant of outcomes. The objectives of this thesis were fivefold. Firstly, to use administrative data from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) of the English Department of Health between 1995 and 2002 to report activity and outcomes for patients recorded as having undergone a radical prostatectomy (RP), radical cystectomy (RC) or radical nephrectomy (RN). Secondly, to develop and validate a comorbidity index for the first time within the HES database. The obtained index, based on the Charlson score, increased with age, was higher in patients admitted as an emergency, and also predicted outcomes. Thirdly, to review the literature to establish to what extent volume could be an explanation for variation in outcomes between surgical providers. This review concluded that surgical outcomes, on average, should improve with increasing hospital or surgeon volume, although the evidence for RN was weakest. Fourthly, to establish, through conducting a national survey, the views of the surgeons performing these procedures regarding 'volume and outcome' relationships. This survey discovered that most consultants supported the principle of volume thresholds, but with wide variation as to where thresholds should be set. Finally, to determine through analysis of the HES data whether post-operative outcomes in England depend on the volume of procedures that a hospital performs. In brief, hospital volume was inversely related to in-hospital mortality following RC. No similar effect was demonstrable following RN. No effect of volume on length of stay after RC or RN was identified, but length of stay after RP was shorter in high volume hospitals. Data from this thesis provides some evidence in support of volume-based health policies for RC, but less support for such policies relating to RN or RP.	 Thesis or dissertation	616.9946059	439840	0

 An examination of organisational issues in third sector organisations which undertake nonviolent direct action	 Carroll, Malcolm C.	 Aston University	 Aston University	2008	 Th is thesis is an examinat ion of organisat ional issues faced by Third Sector organisations which undertake nonviolent direct action. A case sWdy methodology is employed and data gathered from four organisations: Earth First! ; genetiX Snowball; Grecnpeacc; and Trident Ploughshares. The argument commences with a review of the literature which shows that little is known of the organ ising of nonviolent direct action. Operational definitions of 'organ isation ' and "nonviolent direct action' are drawn from the literature. ' Organisation' is conceptualised using new institutionalism. 'Nonvio lent di rect act ion ' is conceptualised using new soci al movement theory. These concepts inform the case study methodology in the choice of case, the organisations se lected and the data gathering tools. Most data were gathered by semi-struclUred interview and participant observation. The research findings result from theory-building arising from th ick descri ptions of the case in the four organisations. The findings suggest that nonviolent di rect ac tion is qualitatively different from terrorism or violence. Although there is much diversity in philosophies of nonviolence, the practice of nonviolent d irect action has much in common across the four organisations. The argument is that nonviolent direct action is an institution. The findings also suggest that new institutionalism is a fruitful approach to st udies of these organi sations. A long with nonviolent direct action, three other institutions are identi fied: ' rules'; consensus decision-making; and 'affinity groups'. An unanticipated fi nding is how the four organisations are instances of innovation . Tentative theory is developed which brings together the seemingly incompatible concepts of in sti tutions and innovation. The theory suggests preconditions and then stages in the development of ncw organisational forms in new social movements: innovmion. The three pre-conditions arc: the existence of an institutional field ; an 'institution-broker' with access to different domains; and a shared 'problem' to resolve. The three stages are: unlocking existing knowledge and practice; bridging different domains of practice or different fie lds to add, develop or translocate those practices; and establishing those practices within their new combinations or novel locations. Participants are able to move into and between these new organisational forms because they consist of familiar and habitual institutional behaviour.

 Extraordinary magnetoresistance in hybrid semiconductor-metal systems	 Hewett, Thomas H.	 Loughborough University	 Loughborough University	2012	Systems that exhibit the extraordinary magnetoresistance (EMR) effect and other more disordered semiconductor-metal hybrid structures have been investigated numerically with the use of the finite element method (FEM). Initially, modelling focused on circular geometry EMR devices where a single metallic droplet is embedded concentrically into a larger semiconducting disk. The dependence of the magnetoresistance of such systems on the transverse magnetic field (0 5T) and filling factor (1/16 15/16) are reported and generally show a very good agreement with existing experimental data. The influence of the geometry of the conducting region of these EMR systems was then investigated. The EMR effect was found to be highly sensitive to the shape of the conducting region with a multi-branched geometry producing a four order of magnitude enhancement of the magnetoresistance over a circular geometry device of the same filling factor. Conformal mapping has previously been shown to transform a circular EMR device into an equivalent linear geometry. Such a linear EMR device has been modelled with the EMR mechanism clearly observed. The magnetoresistive response of a circular EMR device upon changes to: the mobility of the semiconducting region; the ratio of metal to semiconductor conductivity; and the introduction of a finite resistance at the semiconductor-metal interface, have also been investigated. In order for a large EMR effect to be observed the system requires: the semiconductor mobility to be large; the conductivity of the metal to be greater than two orders of magnitude larger than that of the semiconductor; and a very low interface resistance. This modelling procedure has been extended to include inhomogeneous semiconductor-metal hybrids with a more complex and disordered structure. Two models are presented, both based upon the random distribution of a small proportion of metal inside a semiconducting material. The resultant magnetoresistance in each case is found to have a quasi-linear dependence on magnetic field, similar to that observed in the silver chalcogenides.

 Analysis of reliability and validity of critical power testing in the field	 Karsten, Bettina	 University of Greenwich	 University of Greenwich	2014	Critical Power (CP) provides a useful indicator of training status in continuous activities lasting between approximately 2 and 30 minutes. To date, determination of CP has been mostly constrained to the laboratory. The conventional laboratory protocol commonly requires multi-day time-to-exhaustion tests. The thesis below addresses whether CP can a) be determined without multi-day exhaustive trials and b) be determined in the field. Studies compared the findings of conventional laboratory determination methods with novel protocols in which either the testing mode, the recovery period between exhaustive trials, or the environment were manipulated. Study 1 demonstrates that the recently developed 3-min all-out protocol does not result in valid CP values, when using the isokinetic ergometer mode. Results indicated low levels of agreement (mean of 23-45 W) between conventionally determined CP and values derived through the 3-min all-out protocol. The average prediction error associated with the relationship between CP and the 3-min all-out End Power was 7%. In Study 2, values of CP derived through a conventional laboratory CP protocol were compared with those determined outdoors on a cycling track. High levels of agreement (mean of 2 -14 W) were observed between the laboratory and field values of CP. The average prediction error associated with the relationship between laboratory and field CP was 2.2%. Based in the laboratory, Study 3 compares a 24 h recovery protocol with a 3 h and a 30 min recovery protocols. High levels of agreement (mean of -2 - 11 W and -2 - 8 W respectively) were observed across protocols. The average prediction error associated with the relationship between the 24 h and 3 h and the 24 h and 30 min protocols was 2.4% and 3.3% respectively, suggesting that determination of CP could be made more ‘athlete-friendly’ by shortening the conventional 3-day protocol to one day. Study 4 uses three protocols to evaluate the shortened 30 min protocol in ecological valid open road conditions. Values of CP derived from laboratory protocols were compared to a) those derived from pre-planned and ‘grouped’ maximal efforts of 3 min, 7 min and 12 min with a 30 min recovery period between efforts (protocol 1), b) those of discrete and randomly performed, yet still pre-planned maximal efforts of the same durations (protocol 2), and c) to those extracted from self-directed training and racing of these same durations (protocol 3). The average prediction error associated with the relationship between the laboratory and the field values of CP was 3.1% (protocol 1), 4.9% (protocol 2) and 4.1% (protocol 3). Results, whilst providing high levels of agreement, also suggested that in particular protocols 1 and 3 potentially provide a practical and arguably ecologically valid alternative to the conventional laboratory protocol. Study 5 further investigates the overall CP determination procedure by comparing collected values of CP derived through 3 data points with both, CP laboratory and field values derived through 2 data points. High levels of agreement and low prediction errors (average 3.2%) associated with the relationship between 3 data points and 2 data points-derived CP were observed. Studies collectively provide support for the acceptance of field performance testing using CP, with either a 30 min inter-maximal effort recovery period or alternatively the extraction of non-planned specified maximal efforts from training and racing data. Overall the investigations described in the thesis suggest that CP determination is feasible beyond the laboratory and that consumer-level technology provides satisfactory ease and reliability of measurement in this context. Moreover, these novel CP determination methods allow coaches to continuously monitor their athletes.	 Thesis or dissertation	QP Physiology ; RC1200 Sports Medicine	643129	0

 Dynamic routing in circuit-switched non-hierarchical networks	 Eshragh, Nadereh	 Durham University	 Durham University	1989	 This thesis studies dynamic routing in circuit-switched non-hierarchical networks based on learning automata algorithms. The application of a mathematical model for a linear reward penalty algorithm is explained. Theoretical results for this scheme verified by simulations shows the accuracy of the model. Using simulation and analysis, learning automata algorithms are compared to several other strategies on different networks. The implemented test networks may be classified into two groups. The first group are designed for fixed routing and in such networks fixed routing performs better than any dynamic routing scheme. It will be shown that dynamic routing strategies perform as well as fixed routing when trunk reservation is employed. The second group of networks are designed for dynamic routing and trunk reservation deteriorates the performance. Comparison of different routing algorithms on small networks designed to force dynamic routing demonstrates the superiority of automata under both normal and failure conditions. The thesis also considers the instability problem in non-hierarchical circuit-switched networks when dynamic routing is implemented. It is shown that trunk reservation prevents instability and increases the carried load at overloads. Finally a set of experiments are performed on large networks with realistic capacity and traffic matrices. Simulation and analytic results show that dynamic routing outperforms fixed routing and trunk reservation deteriorates the performance at low values of overload. At high overloads, optimization of trunk reservation is necessary for this class of networks. Comparison results show the improved performance with automata schemes under both normal and abnormal traffic conditions. The thesis concludes with a discussion of proposed further work including expected developments in Integrated Service Digital Networks.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Electronic devices 	278152	0
 Development of a novel bead display technology to identify protein ligands : application to identification of viral entry inhibitors and T-cell epitopes	 Huang, Li-Chieh	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2013	With the continued need for drug discovery and the quest to understand disease and treatment, there remains a requirement for improved methods to study protein-protein interactions and to identify potential drug leads for protein targets. We sought to develop a new approach to directly link genotype and phenotype to use as a probe for the identification of binding partners of proteins. The method creates millions of water-in-oil emulsions, each of which functions as a micro-environment for the amplification of a library of random peptide-encoding DNA molecules, which covalently bind to a bead. Subsequently the emulsions are broken and the bead-DNA complexes are recovered, which subsequently form another emulsion with in vitro transcription and translation components and incubated under suitable protein synthesis conditions. The synthetic peptide is designed with tags that link to the same bead which it is translated from. In chapter 3, the detailed design and optimisation of the method will be discussed. Cross-clade neutralising antibodies specific to HIV-1 are rare, partly because glycosylation restricts access to conserved backbone residues of gp120. In chapter 4, we hypothesized that peptides may have greater access than relatively large antibody structures, and so used our method to display random peptides on beads using a protein domain scaffold. Using a single round of selection, we identified 22 gp120-binding peptides, 4 of which were able to inhibit HIV-1 replication in vitro. One of the inhibitory peptides was found to bind the CCR5/CXCR4-binding site of gp120 and was able to inhibit clade B and C CCR5-tropic isolates of HIV-1. We have identified HIV-1 cross-clade neutralising peptides using a novel in vitro bead display library. Comprehensive antigenic characterization of a T cell population of unknown specificity is challenging. Existing MHC class I expression systems are limited by the practical difficulty of probing cell populations with an MHC class I peptide library and the cross-reactivity of T cells that are able to recognise many variants of an index peptide. We reasoned that a bead-based display high-throughput approach may overcome these challenges. Using emulsion PCR and emulsion in vitro transcription/translation of a random library of peptides conjugated to β-2-microglobulin on beads, we refolded with exogenous wild-type HLA-A*0201 or CD8-null A*0201 (domains 1 and 2 of HLA-A*0201 and domain 3 of Kb with mutated residues 226A/227L). The HLA bead libraries were used to probe HLA-A*0201-restricted T cells with specificity for influenza, CMV and EBV. High-throughput sequencing was used to rank sequences of identified peptides. Compared to pre-selection sequences, we observed significant enrichment for sequences containing HLA-A2 anchors and correct viral fragments for all T cell populations. HLA bead display provides a novel approach to identify the specificity of T cells. In summary, we combine the convenient handling of beads, the homogeneity of micro-environment in emulsion, and next-generation sequencing to create an attractive alternative to identify ligands of protein targets and antigenic peptides.

Healthy, wealthy and wise? : working past age 65 in the UK and USA	 Lain, David	 University of Sussex	 Sussex University	2009	This thesis provides a comparative analysis of employment past age 65 in the UK and USA in the early 2000s, using large-scale government surveys from both countries. In the USA we argue a 'policy logic' of 'self-reliance' was dominant, under which people were expected to time their retirement according to their financial needs. In the UK, on the other hand, a policy logic of 'paternalism' was evident, which assumed that individuals would retire at or before age 65. In the first empirical chapter we examine how demand for labour interacts with policy to shape the job opportunities open to people in their sixties. In the next two chapters we examine whether the poor in the USA were more likely to work past 65 than the poor in the UK, because of the dominant policy logic of self-reliance in the USA. First, we examine this with reference to marital status and gender, to see if female widows and divorcees, the poorest marital-status groups in both countries, were more likely to work past 65 in the USA than in the UK. Second, we examine the question in relation to wealth, rather than income, and incorporate the influences of health and education into the analysis - as low levels of health and education are likely to act as barriers to employment for the poorest. In the concluding chapter we argue that although moving towards a self-reliance policy logic in the UK would increase employment amongst those aged 65 and over, it would do less to benefit the poorest who have the greatest financial need to work, but are prevented from working by low qualifications and bad health.

The spatial and temporal regulation of the monomeric G protein, Ras 1	 Weston, Cathryn A.	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	2013	A vast array of cellular processes are controlled by the highly conserved guanine nucleotide-regulated molecular switches, such as Ras. The spatial and temporal regulation of Ras signalling, both positively, through the action of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and negatively, via interaction with GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) is critical to maintain cell viability. Due to the presence of multiple Ras isoforms, regulatory proteins and effectors, the study of Ras signalling in higher eukaryotes is technically challenging. Fission yeast provides a simple system in which to study Ras signalling containing a single Ras homologue (Ras1) that modulates two distinct processes. Ras1 signalling is terminated through GTP-hydrolysis accelerated by the action of a GAP, Gap1. This thesis describes the development of a quantitative FRET assay to visualise the dynamics of Ras1 activity within single cells. Using this reporter, in combination with a variety of other quantitative techniques, the role of the negative regulator during signal transduction was explored. These results highlighted an important difference between the requirement for GTPhydrolysis during signal propagation. Finally, use of the FRET reporter revealed an alternative G protein state, within the Ras1 activation cycle. These data question the accepted models of G protein signal propagation and prompt further investigation into the roles of GTP-hydrolysis in signal transduction. Several positive regulators of Ras1 have previously been described in fission yeast. These proteins have been proposed to direct signalling via the different Ras1 effectors. Using quantitative image analysis and pheromoneresponsive reporter strains, this thesis presents data to suggest that it is not simply a one-activator-one-effector response. Further, the role of the previously uncharacterised, scaffold protein, Ral2 in mediating signal transduction is also investigated. Finally the possibility that the heterotrimeric G protein, Gpa1 can directly activate MAPK signalling to provide a pheromone-sensing mechanism within fission yeast is discussed.

 Characterisation of oxy-fuel flames using laser based diagnostics techniques	 Meor Zulkifli, Meor Mohd Faisal	 Imperial College London	 Imperial College London	2016	Oxygen enhanced oxy-fuel laminar and turbulent flame structure in a co-flow non-premixed jet burner are investigated. The measurement of intermediate species such as hydroxyl (OH) and formaldehyde (CH2O) and temperature are the focus of this work. The species concentrations were measured using planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) and the temperature using Rayleigh scattering. ‘Traditional Rayleigh’ requires a constant Rayleigh cross-section throughout the combustion process. This is impossible in high temperature oxy-fuel flames due to thermal decomposition. Derived temperature from Rayleigh signals is hence prone to inaccuracy. A direct comparison of measured and numerically-calculated Rayleigh signals can eliminate this error. Numerical Rayleigh signals are relatively easily calculated with knowledge of temperature and species concentration. The feasibility of adopting this procedure to validate the numerical model was investigated in laminar and turbulent flames. Sensitivity studies including radiation models, chemical kinetics mechanisms and the Soret effect were performed in laminar flames. Another Rayleigh technique, polarised/ depolarised Rayleigh was employed in a joint temperature, OH and CH2O measurement. The effect of varying O2 and jet Reynolds number on the flame structure was investigated.

 From the triple helix model (THM) to an actor flow model (AFM) : two case studies on the co-creative evolutionary relationship between universities, industry, the government, and a research institute in Taiwan	 Huang, Chia-Pin John	 University of Bath	 University of Bath	2012	The need for collaboration among different institutional actors including, universities, industry and governments, in national innovation systems, has been championed by the creators of the Triple Helix Model (e.g., Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff, 1995). However, these authors played down the importance of research institutes in these interactions during the evolution of innovation. Moreover, although under the THM it is accepted that there are flows of resources between actors, this has yet to be comprehensively conceptualised. To address these issues, in this research the THM is extended to a model that not only includes the role of research institutes, but also allows for examination of the energy flows during successful innovations, involving: human, knowledge. money and physical resources, entitled the Actor Flow Model (AFM). Further, central to this concept of 'flow', an evolutionary perspective ofinc1usionality (Huang, 20 10) is posited as a possible enhancement of the innovative process. This is a new evolutionary perspective conceived by Rayner (2006, 2010), a micro-biologist, who found that the evolution of the mycelia and other natural phenomena are not driven solely by competition, as Darwinists forecast, but by the facilitation of dynamic energy flows and their mutual influencing relationships across space. That is, central to this aspect of the thesis is the notion of interdependency between parties in the innovatory process. This model is then applied to case studies of two inventions in Taiwan that involved collaboration between the four aforementioned actors to show how its constructs offer an improvement on the THM, regarding its explanatory power for successful innovations. The two focal inventions originate from different technological fields: biomedical and optoelectronics. A further element that this thesis shows is that the language used needs to change in order to generate an inc1usional and transformational journey. The language used in this narrative changes with the development of my epistemology.	 Thesis or dissertation	658.4063	600723	0
 An examination of the mental health service provision in Saudi Arabia with particular reference to counselling	 Almoshawah, Saad A. S.	 University of Hull	 University of Hull	2005	This thesis aimed at elucidating the meaning of mental health services within the context of counselling practice in Saudi Arabia. The delineation of mental health practice within this context may help to overcome the incongruence among counselling theory, research, practice, and the experience of counselling patients in that country. Consequently, mental health treatment systems in Saudi Arabia have a history of incompatible philosophies and conflicts that have been associated with poor treatment outcomes for persons diagnosed, which was linked to a deterrent Poor Law to one which incorporated those suffering from a wide range of mental disturbances, which was largely based on treatment willingly undertaken and freely available, and which was associated with a preventive Ministry of Health. It examines the concepts and intentions which underlay policy, and the impact of policy upon the service and its clients. It describes the ways in which the service was moulded by the changing and sometimes conflicting demands of the needs of the mentally patients' and of society as a whole. There is almost full agreement among all those concerned with Psychiatric health care in Saudi Arabia that current treatment is not beneficial and may be harmful to the patients'. Most psychiatrists agree that the major benefit for the patient occur in the first week of his \her treatment. Mental health provision in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia hospitals, historical background and the use of the current medical model, is examined in the first part of the study and qualitative and quantitative methodology were used in the second part. From the analysis, the questionnaire, and exploratory interviews the major findings were, revealed statistically significant differences between practitioners in their aims and objectives, roles and responsibilities, awareness, effectiveness' , referral system and procedures, and personal development. Although, practitioners experienced dissatisfaction with the whole service; patients' were raised the same issues criticising the poor standard of services in their hospitals. In addition, practitioners felt the referral system was inflexible and unclear, psychiatrists and counsellors failed to understand their patients' needs. It was concluded that there were considerable the lack of training amongst practitioners. In the light of the findings, the researcher came up with several recommendations, the most important of which were the following. I ) there is a need for a viable model for mental health treatment in Saudi Arabia.;2) Improve the current provision regulation;3) establish a mental health Act in Saudi Arabia.

 The apostate's wake : cultures of Irish Catholicism in James Joyce's Finnegans wake	 Van Mierlo, Christine	 Royal Holloway, University of London	 University of London	2012	This project takes a new approach to the treatment of Catholicism in Finnegans Wake, by looking beyond established theological and philosophical readings in order to focus on the intricacies of Joyce's engagement with Irish Catholic culture, c. 1850•1 939. This period accounts for the years of Cardinal Cullen's 'devotional revolution' in Ireland, for the formation of-the deeply conservative and Rome-centred religious culture into which Joyce was born, and for the emergence of a new Irish Catholic state following the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921. As my tide suggests, this thesis highlights Joyce's critique of the Church. Adopting a historicist methodology, and drawing upon extensive archival research, I consider how Joyce's sources-both textual and cultural-are transformed through his revolutionary aesthetic into a radical dismantling of Irish Catholic society. Topics considered include the following: the role of the artist-intellectual in the 'new' Ireland, as shown through the portrait of Shem the Penman; the nature and reach of Joyce's devastating anticlerical satire of Shaun; the difficulties faced by unmarried Irish Catholic girls, as embodied by Issy, and the impact of ALP's concerted attack on the material culture of Irish Catholicism, an act that is performed in defence of her husband. The final section of this thesis rums LO the historical complexities of Book IV. It attempts to articulate how ALP's closing monologue can be understood against the backdrop of a new dawn of conservative Irish Catholicism, and in relation to the decline of the Anglicized patriarch HCE.

The regulation of Wt1 in the epicardium by the SWI/SNF-like BAF complex and thymosin β4	 Howard, S.	 University College London (University of London)	 University College London (University of London)	2014	During development, cells of the epicardium undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to generate multipotent progenitor cells (epicardium-derived cells, EPDCs) that contribute to multiple lineages of the cardiovascular system. Critical to this process is the epicardially-expressed Wilms’ tumour 1 (Wt1) gene. In the adult, the epicardium is largely quiescent and no longer expresses Wt1. Upon myocardial infarction (MI), however, the adult epicardium is reactivated; it re-expresses Wt1, reverts to its embryonic potency, and contributes to cardiac repair. Previous work showed that this reactivation is enhanced by ‘priming’ mice with the G-actin-binding protein thymosin β4 (Tβ4), although the molecular mechanisms were not defined. Here we investigated Wt1 regulation in the epicardium during development and post-MI and found Wt1 to be regulated by the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex in combination with Tβ4. During development, Wt1-expressing cells in the epicardium expressed the SWI/SNF ATPases, Brg1 and Brm. Both Wt1 and SWI/SNF were largely absent from the uninjured adult epicardium, but the re-expression of Wt1 post-MI was accompanied by substantial upregulation of both Brg1 and Brm. Exogenous Tβ4 in the form of priming increased the post-MI expression of Wt1, Brg1 and Brm, whilst endogenous Tβ4 was found to be required for maximal Wt1 reactivation. Furthermore, we found that Tβ4 physically interacts with the SWI/SNF complex and that it potentiates SWI/SNF-mediated activation of specific regulatory regions of the Wt1 promoter and intron 1, suggesting that this interaction is functional. Loss of Brg1 in the epicardium using Gata5Cre;Brg1flox embryos showed that Brg1 is not required for Wt1 expression, which we postulate is due to compensation from Brm, whilst loss of Brg1 in Wt1-expressing lineages (using the tamoxifen-inducible Wt1CreERT2) caused no obvious phenotype. Further understanding of the mechanisms underlying Wt1 expression, during both development and epicardial reactivation post-MI, is essential in our quest to utilise resident-cell-based therapy in cardiac repair.

 The effects of hypoxia on chemical toxicity in two model fish species	 Fitzgerald, Jennifer	 University of Exeter	 University of Exeter	2016	Hypoxia is a global and increasingly important stressor in aquatic ecosystems, with major impacts on biodiversity worldwide. Hypoxic waters are often contaminated with a wide range of chemicals but knowledge is limited about the interactions between hypoxia and chemical stressors. Therefore, during this PhD I set out to investigate how the concentration of oxygen in the water influences chemical toxicity in fish. My work focused on two groups of chemicals: toxic metals, of which copper was used as an example, and anti-androgenic chemicals. Copper is an essential metal, widespread in the aquatic environment, but it can become toxic to aquatic organisms when environmental levels become too high. Copper and hypoxia are likely to co-occur but despite this our understanding of the interactions between these two stressors is limited. To address this, I performed a series of experiments using both the zebrafish (Danio rerio) and the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as fish models. I first investigated the effects of hypoxia on copper toxicity to zebrafish embryos during development. Copper toxicity was reduced by over 2-fold under hypoxia compared to normoxia during the first day of development, and I demonstrated that this protective effect was associated with the activation of the hypoxia inducible factor pathway. In contrast, hypoxia increased copper toxicity in hatched larvae, which was deduced to be associated with differential copper uptake. To test if the interactions between copper and low oxygen observed for the zebrafish also occurred for other fish species, exposures were conducted in a species with a lower tolerance to hypoxia, the three-spined stickleback. The results obtained showed that hypoxia suppressed copper toxicity prior to hatching, but after hatching this effect was reversed, similarly to that observed for the zebrafish. This suggests a potential conserved effect of hypoxia on copper toxicity during embryogenesis across fish species. To investigate if life stage influences the interactions between low oxygen and copper toxicity, the effects of combined exposures were assessed in the adult male three-spined stickleback. The critical oxygen level (Pcrit) was determined to allow appropriate experimental design. The combined exposures to copper and low oxygen resulted in a decreased ability to acclimate to low oxygen. Fish were able to lower their Pcrit in response to low oxygen conditions when exposed to hypoxia alone but not when exposed to hypoxia in combination with copper. Together, these datasets support the hypothesis that the life stage influences the effects of the combined exposure, as hypoxia protects from copper toxicity during early embryogenesis but increases copper toxicity in hatched embryos and in adults. I then investigated whether hypoxia can affect the toxicity of another widespread group of pollutants, anti-androgenic chemicals. Male three-spined sticklebacks were exposed to three anti-androgenic chemicals, flutamide, linuron and fenitrothion, under different air saturations. Each chemical had a unique transcriptional response alone and in combination with reduced oxygen saturation. Under both air saturations, spiggin transcription was strongly inhibited by exposure to flutamide. In contrast, exposure to fenitrothion did not result in a significant effect on spiggin transcription. Interestingly, linuron strongly inhibited spiggin under 100% air saturation, but this effect was absent under low air saturation, potentially as a result of interactions between the hypoxia inducible factor pathway and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathway. This work illustrates the potential mechanisms responsible for interactions between reduced oxygen and chemical toxicity, especially for aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonists, and highlights how hypoxia can modify the effects of a variety of chemicals with diverse modes of action. My research highlights the importance of considering the interactions between multiple stressors, and the need to take into account the type of chemical, life stage, and the species tolerance. Understanding these interactions is essential to facilitate the accurate prediction of the consequences of exposure to complex stressors in a rapidly changing environment.

 Investigating genotype-phenotype correlations and potential therapies for laminopathies	 Scharner, Juergen	 King's College London (University of London)	 King's College London (University of London)	2014	Laminopathies are a heterogeneous group of diseases associated with mutations in A-type lamins, which together with B-type lamins, form the nuclear lamina: a proteinaceous network underlying the nuclear membrane. A-type lamins are encoded by the LA1NA gene, and more than 300 mutations have been described, associated with more than 16 phenotypes. The majority of mutations affect striated muscle to cause Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) or cardiomyopathy, while others result in lipodystrophy, neuropathy or premature ageing syndromes. However, clear genotype-phenotype correlations are not established, the pathogenic mechanisms are little understood and therapies are lacking. -- This thesis first explores genotype-phenotype for LMZV/4 mutations and makes correlations by characterising both physical-chemical properties of the amino-acid change, and position in the 3D structure of lamin A. LMNsl mutations associated with muscular dystrophies, premature ageing disorders and lipodystrophies clustered in the Ig-fold domain of lamin A and resulted in a similar change in charge, suggesting that modification of specific protein-protein interactions contribute to different phenotypes. -- Next, I investigated the effects of four pathogenic EDMD mutations on nuclear morphology, nuclear protein distribution and myogenic cell function. I found that some mutations led to severe nuclear deformations and mislocalisation of lamin B, while others caused accumulation of lamin A-positive nuclear foci. Myogenic differentiation was mildly affected by some mutant lamin A species. -- Finally, I describe a series of proof-of-principle experiments investigating a potential therapeutic intervention for laminopathies. A lamin A variant with a deletion corresponding to regions encoded by exon 5, removing 42 amino acids in the central rod domain, localised correctly.	 Thesis or dissertation	616.7	628502	0

 Consumed : stilled lives and the pathologies of capitalism	 Woolley, Dawn	 Royal College of Art	 Royal College of Art	2017	 The aim of the research is to identify pathological relations between consumer culture and consumers. I explore the relation between people and objects, and the impact that images have as producers and disseminators of sign-value. Taking the term ‘advertisement’ loosely I refer to Dutch still-life paintings as advertisements for the craft-objects they depict and the lifestyles they suggest. The body is also considered to be an advertisement because of the commodities with which it is adorned and the socially prescribed ideals that it reinforces. I consider social networking sites as commercial spaces where body ideals are disseminated. Different forms of self-presentation, including selfies, thinspiration, and fat fetishism are examined as indications of the recuperation of aberrant signs in the system of sign-value exchange. The analytical methodology for this enquiry is framed by theories of commodity fetishism and sexual fetishism through which I consider both the socio-economic and the psychosexual dimensions of the relation between consumer society and individual consumers. I examine sexual fetishism and kleptomania by reference to psychoanalytic case studies in order to chart how objects are inscribed with value. Fetishists and kleptomaniacs endow seemingly trivial objects with a value that is incomprehensible to other people. These unusual relations to objects offer an alternative model for evaluating the value of commodities in a manner that might liberate the body of the consumer. The practical aspect of the research centres on the still-life. Taking my cue from Dutch still-life paintings from the seventeenth century that reflected a conflicting relation with material wealth, I produce still-life objects that reflect a contradictory relationship to consumerism. I produce still-life photographs in order to develop an alternative visual language for the commodified and objectified contemporary consumer body.	 Thesis or dissertation	W640 Photography	715202	0

 Structural and statistical aspects in joint modelling of artesunate pharmacometrics and malarial parasite lifecycle	 Hall, Adam J.	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	2015	 Malaria is a parasite with a complex lifecycle, and commonly used antimalarial agents from the artemisinin family have varied effectiveness over different stages of this lifecycle. The pharmacokinetic profile of the artemisinins is also strongly influenced by the parasite burden and lifecycle stage. This work introduces a new pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic model incorporating these interdependent drug and lifecycle features, for orally administered artesunate and its principal metabolite dihydroartemisinin. This model, like the underlying system whose features it attempts to capture, is quite complex and cannot be solved analytically like standard linear first-order compartmental models previously used for pharmacokinetic modelling of these drugs. Therefore, understanding, inference and validity are explored through use of the modern statistical technique of a Sequential Monte Carlo sampler. Structural, numerical and practical identifiability are important concepts for all models, the latter two especially so in this case as the model structure does not admit an algebraic structural identifiability analysis. Motivated by this, the above identifiability concepts are also investigated in connection with the Sequential Monte Carlo technique. Sequential Monte Carlo is demonstrated to be a useful tool for gaining insight into models whose structural identifiability is not known, just as it is also shown to have significant advantages in parameter inference over the classical approach. The coupled parasite lifecycle and artemisinin-derivative model is built in stages, starting with an in vitro submodel capturing the dynamics of uptake of artemisinins into parasitised and non-parasitised red blood cells. Next, the parasite lifecycle, or ‘ageing’ model, is introduced, which uses a new concept of shadow compartments to achieve its aims of describing ageing in continuous time and to exhibit sufficient control over the parasite population. Finally, these models are integrated together into the full coupled pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic model. More work is needed to fully assess the resultant model on clinical datasets, but the building blocks upon which it was constructed appear to fulfil their aims reasonably well.

First, how does the composition of public expenditure affect the economic growth rate of macroeconomic variables such as the real output of the non-oil sector, employment, and total imports in Libya? Second, what is the appropriate fiscal and/or monetary policy to be used by the Libyan government to finance public expenditure, especially after the collapse in the oil price in the 1990s? To achieve these ends, a small macro-econometric model of the Libyan economy is constructed for the period 1962-1992 and estimated using the Johansen approach. The model reflects the Libyan institutional environment relevant to the observation period. The model links public finances to the monetary sector, the real sector, the role of foreign trade and the balance of payments, and the labour market. The model is utilised to (1) examine the impact of government expenditure on the growth of the macro-economic variables mentioned above; (2) examine the impact of different ways of funding these expenditures; (3) examine long-run equilibrium relationships estimated through the cointegration approach. The short-run dynamics was modelled via error correction models. Evaluation of the model was through standard single equation diagnostics, model simulation, and forecasting. Policy simulation was used to evaluate macro-economic policy options open to the government of Libya. As a result this study provides considerable knowledge about the structure of the Libyan economy through the period 1962-1992, and about the impact of government expenditure and its finance instrument (fiscal and/or monetary means) on growth.

 Applications of focal-series data in scanning-transmission electron microscopy	 Jones, Lewys	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2013	 Since its development, the scanning transmission electron microscope has rapidly found uses right across the material sciences. Its use of a finely focussed electron probe rastered across samples offers the microscopist a variety of imaging and spectroscopy signals in parallel. These signals are individually intuitive to interpret, and collectively immensely powerful as a research tool. Unsurprisingly then, much attention is concentrated on the optical quality of the electron probes used. The introduction of multi-pole hardware to correct optical distortions has yielded a step-change in imaging performance; now with spherical and other remnant aberrations greatly reduced, larger probe forming apertures are suddenly available. Probes formed by such apertures exhibit a much improved and routinely sub-Angstrom diffraction-limited resolution, as well as a greatly increased probe current for spectroscopic work. The superb fineness of the electron beams and enormous magnifications now achievable make the STEM instrument one of the most sensitive scientific instruments developed by man, and this thesis will deal with two core issues that suddenly become important in this new aberration-corrected era. With this new found sensitivity comes the risk of imaging-distortion from outside influences such as acoustic or mechanical vibrations. These can corrupt the data in an unsatisfactory manner and counter the natural interpretability of the technique. Methods to identify and diagnose this distortion will be discussed, and a new technique developed to restore the corrupted data presented. Secondly, the subtleties of probe-shape in the multi-pole corrected STEM are extensively evaluated via simulation, with the contrast-transfer capabilities across defocus explored in detail. From this investigation a new technique of STEM focal-series reconstruction (FSR) is developed to compensate for the small remnant aberrations that still persist – recovering the sample object function free from any optical distortion. In both cases the methodologies were developed into automated computer codes and example restorations from the two techniques are shown (separately, although in principal the scan-corrected output is compatible with FSR). The performance of these results has been quantified with respect to several factors including; image resolution, signal-noise ratio, sample-drift, low frequency instability, and quantitative image intensity. The techniques developed are offered as practical tools for the microscopist wishing to push the performance of their instrument just that little bit further.

 Micellar chromatographic partition coefficients and their application in predicting skin permeability	 Shahzad, Yasser	 University of Huddersfield	 University of Huddersfield	2013	 The major goal for physicochemical screening of pharmaceuticals is to predict human drug absorption, distribution, elimination, excretion and toxicity. These are all dependent on the lipophilicity of the drug, which is expressed as a partition coefficient i.e. a measure of a drug’s preference for the lipophilic or hydrophilic phases. The most common method of determining a partition coefficient is the shake flask method using octanol and water as partitioning media. However, this system has many limitations when modeling the interaction of ionised compounds with membranes, therefore, unreliable partitioning data for many solutes has been reported. In addition to these concerns, the procedure is tedious and time consuming and requires a high level of solute and solvent purity. Micellar liquid chromatography (MLC) has been proposed as an alternative technique for measuring partition coefficients utilising surfactant aggregates, known as micelles. This thesis investigates the application of MLC in determining micelle-water partition coefficients (logPMW) of pharmaceutical compounds of varying physicochemical properties. The effect of mobile phase pH and column temperature on the partitioning of compounds was evaluated. Results revealed that partitioning of drugs solely into the micellar core was influenced by the interaction of charged and neutral species with the surface of the micelle. Furthermore, the pH of the mobile phase significantly influenced the partitioning behaviour and a good correlation of logPMW was observed with calculated distribution coefficient (logD) values. More interestingly, a significant change in partitioning was observed near the dissociation constant of each drug indicating an influence of ionised species on the association with the micelle and retention on the stationary phase. Elevated column temperatures confirmed partitioning of drugs considered in this study was enthalpically driven with a small change in the entropy of the system because of the change in the nature of hydrogen bonding. Finally, a quantitative structure property relationship was developed to evaluate biological relevance in terms of predicting skin permeability of the newly developed partition coefficient values. This study provides a better surrogate for predicting skin permeability based on an easy, fast and cheap experimental methodology, and the method holds the predictive capability for a wider population of drugs. In summary, it can be concluded that MLC has the ability to generate partition coefficient values in a shorter time with higher accuracy, and has the potential to replace the octanol-water system for pharmaceutical compounds.

 Assessing a threat to sustainable NTFP harvest using ecological data and traditional ecological knowledge	 Rist, Lucy	 Imperial College London	 Imperial College London	2009	Sustainable harvesting of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and associated livelihood security can be compromised by changes in the broader ecosystem. This study investigates mistletoe infection of Amla, Phyllanthus emblica and Phyllanthus indofische7i, an NTFP of significant livelihood importance, in the Biligiri Rangaswarny Temple (BRT) Wildlife Sanctuary in southern India. Infection patterns of the Loranthaceae mistletoe, Taxillus tomentosus, were characterised across the Amla population and their underlying mechanisms explored. Two alternative management approaches were investigated, and traditional ecological knowledge documented and assessedfo r its concordance and additionality to scientific data. A high prevalence of infection, and the apparent greater susceptibility of the more significant resource species, suggests that mistletoe infection has serious implications for Amla sustainability. Traditional knowledge provided novel information on infection spread, and highlighted failings in current population assessments, emphasising the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to assessing sustainability. Traditional approaches to management conflict with current institutional perspectives, but may be somewhat more effective and require further investigation. However, existing data, both from scientific studies and traditional knowledge, are insufficient to prescribe with certainty the best approach to mistletoe control. The participatory implementation of an active adaptive management programme may offer benefits over alternative management options for securing Amla as a viable NTFP harvesting system.

 The effect of tumour microstructure on diffusion-weighted MRI measurements	 McHugh, Damien Joseph	 University of Manchester	 University of Manchester	2015	 By sensitising the magnetic resonance signal to the diffusion of water molecules in tissue, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging provides a means of assessing tumour microstructure non-invasively. Such measurements have the potential to provide important information about tumour development and the response of tumours to treatment, but the way in which different tissue properties affect the diffusion-weighted signal remains unclear. Through simulations, in vivo studies and phantom experiments, this thesis investigates the relationship between the diffusion-weighted signal, the pulse sequence parameters used for acquisition, and microstructural properties of tumours. The use of oscillating gradient pulse sequences on a clinical scanner was investigated initially, with theoretical and practical considerations leading subsequent work to focus on pulsed gradient sequences. The forward problem of predicting the diffusion-weighted signal for given combinations of tissue properties and sequence parameters was addressed numerically through Monte Carlo simulations, focussing on how tumour cell size, intracellular volume fraction and membrane permeability affect the signal. These simulations allowed the sensitivity of the signal to changes in these tissue properties to be investigated, revealing how sensitivity depends on sequence parameters as well as the specific microstructural configuration. By repeating the simulations using the specific sequence parameters used in a clinical and preclinical study, the sensitivity of the implemented protocols was assessed, and linked to the experimental findings. The preclinical study illustrated the importance of the diffusion time in determining the sensitivity to treatment-induced changes in tumours, with larger post-treatment signal changes observed at longer diffusion times. These trends were qualitatively reflected in the sensitivity analysis derived from the simulations. Finally, the inverse problem of estimating microstructural properties from the diffusion-weighted signal was addressed using a physical phantom designed as a simple mimic of tumour tissue. By fitting a biophysical model to the diffusion data, the size and volume fraction of the approximately spherical 'cells' were estimated. The radius was slightly underestimated compared with that determined from independent measurements, the fitted volume fraction was plausible, and parameters were found to be estimated with reasonably good precision.

 Evidence synthesis and decision modelling in public health	 Achana, Felix Adjuah	 University of Leicester	 University of Leicester	2015	This thesis focuses on the challenges of evidence synthesis to inform healthcare decision making within public health. It encompasses both methodological advancement and practical application of existing synthesis methodology, using as an example - accidents prevention in children to illustrate application of the methods within a public health context. The thesis commences with a systematic review of NICE public health appraisals to identify the barriers to quantitative synthesis of evidence in public health. Then focusing on the prevention of unintentional poisonings in pre-school children, a series of network metaanalyses of the effectiveness evidence are conducted, demonstrating how complex synthesis methodology can be employed to help overcome some challenges of evidence synthesis in a identified in the review of the NICE public health appraisals. New synthesis methodology is then developed in which the standard network meta-analysis model is first extended to include a covariate for the baseline risk and then to a multiple outcome settings. Baseline risk is a proxy for unmeasured but important patient-level characteristics, which may be modifiers of the treatment effect in a meta-analysis. Thus adjusting for it can account for heterogeneity across different study populations and identify those more likely to benefit from the intervention. The multiple outcome models account for the dependency structure within the data which is important in a decision modelling context, as correlations between effect estimates on different outcomes may have implications for estimating the net benefit associated with treatment. Finally, a substantive decision analytic model is presented incorporating results from the network meta-analysis and application of the methodology developed to the poison prevention data. The analyses suggest that compared to usual care, more intensive home safety interventions are more effective in preventing medicinal poisonings in pre-school children but are unlikely to be cost-effective for the UK NHS unless policy makers are willing to pay upwards of £75,000 for every QALY gained.

 Cordless access to the basic rate service of ISDN using DECT technology	 Ip, W. H.	 Swansea University 	 University College of Swansea	1995	 This thesis describes research that has been carried out by the author into the feasibility of providing a cordless (radio) access to the basic rate service of the integrated services digital network (ISDN). The radio technology investigated is based on that recently adopted as the pan-European cordless standard known as the Digital European Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) standard. Although in the standard it is envisaged that DECT will provide support for the basic service of ISDN, the actual interworking details between the two systems have still to be defined. This research, therefore, contributes to this aspect of the standard. The proposed scheme endeavours to merge the two systems together so as to provide transparent, cordless access to the basic rate service of ISDN. All aspects of the interworking approach have been fully researched and the operation of the interworking unit has been formulated in the form of a finite state machine. Most of the reported results for predicting the performance of a DECT radio link have been obtained using testbeds and relate to path loss, signal-to-noise ratio and fading characteristics. Although these parameters provide a good estimation of the performance of a link for voice services - in terms of bit error rate for example - in general, for the more stringent requirements of data services, the link performance of a channel, especially one of poor quality, dictates that an error correction scheme must be used. To date, however, the provision of data services over DECT has not yet been studied in detail. This research therefore also contributes to this aspect of the DECT standard. Two error correction schemes have been proposed and their performance under different channel conditions have been quantified. The results are based on error measurements obtained from a DECT testbed and computer simulation modelling has been used to investigate the performance of both schemes.

The German question and the international order (1943-8) : an English school approach	 Lewkowicz, Nicolas Abel	 University of Nottingham	 University of Nottingham	2008	Using the interpretative framework of the English School of international relations, the thesis explores the extent to which the inter-Allied treatment of the German Question during the 1943-8 period influenced the making of the post-war international order. Linking international relations theory with historical research, the thesis reinstates the importance of the resolution of the German Question as the most influential issue in the development of the post-war international order. The thesis explores the institutionalisation of international relations and the dynamic interaction of the legal, consensual and conflictual elements involved in the treatment of the German Question, portraying them as the main informative aspects of the origins of the Cold War international order. Employing the 'trilateral approach' espoused by Martin Wight, the thesis tackles the Realist aspects of the treatment of the German Question by analysing superpower interaction in relation to the enforcement of their structural interests and the socialisation of conflict at occupation and diplomatic level. The thesis evaluates the transformation which occurred in Germany and the post-war international order due to the inter-Allied work on denazification. The thesis also analyses the Rationalist aspects of superpower interaction, with particular emphasis on the legal and diplomatic framework which sustained not only the treatment of the German Question but also the general context of inter-Allied relations. The main conclusion of the thesis is that by restricting superpower intervention to specific spheres of influence, the treatment of the German Question contributed to the creation of a `pluralist plus' international order which inhibited a systemic disruption of the bipolar settlement imposed by the main Allies.

 Services for biological network feature detection	 Gollapudi, Venkata Lakshmi Sirisha	 University of Nottingham	 University of Nottingham	2010	 The complex environment of a living cell contains many molecules interacting in a variety of ways. Examples include the physical interaction between two proteins, or the biochemical interaction between an enzyme and its substrate. A challenge of systems biology is to understand the network of interactions between biological molecules, derived experimentally or computationally. Sophisticated dynamic modelling approaches provide detailed knowledge about single processes or individual pathways. However such methods are far less tractable for holistic cellular models, which are instead represented at the level of network topology. Current network analysis packages tend to be standalone desktop tools which rely on local resources and whose operations are not easily integrated with other software and databases. A key contribution of this thesis is an extensible toolkit of biological network construction and analysis operations, developed as web services. Web services are a distributed technology that enable machine-to-machine interaction over a network, and promote interoperability by allowing tools deployed on heterogeneous systems to interface. A conceptual framework has been created, which is realised practically through the proposal of a common graph format to standardise network data, and the investigation of open-source deployment technologies. Workflows are a graph of web services, allowing analyses to be carried out as part of a bigger software pipeline. They may be constructed using web services within the toolkit together with those from other providers, and can be saved, shared and reused, allowing biologists to construct their own complex queries over various tools and datasets, or execute pre-constructed workflows designed by expert bioinformaticians. Biologically relevant results have been produced as a result of this approach. One very interesting hypothesis has been generated regarding the regulation of yeast glycolysis by a protein found to interact with seven glycolytic enzymes. This has implied a potentially novel regulatory mechanism whereby the protein in question binds these enzymes to form an 'energy production unit'. Also of interest are workflows which identify termini (system inputs and outputs), and cycles, which are crucial for acquiring a physiological perspective on network behaviour.

 The development of non-contact laser and EMAT ultrasound measurement systems for hot steel	 Rohani, Md Supar	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	1996	Non-contact laser and EMAT ultrasound systems have been developed for ultrasound measurements on hot steel. The pulsed lasers are capable of generating wide bandwidth ultrasound pulses and the transduction is entirely remote. The EMATs operate in close vicinity to the metal testpiece and can be used for both generation and detection of ultrasound. EMATs require no special surface preparation of the steel samples and the performance may even be enhanced by the presence of oxides on the surface. The EMAT can be operated either using a permanent magnet (P-EMAT) or a pulsed field electromagnet (E-EMAT); the latter is capable of producing a magnetic field over 1Tesla and would allow the easy removal of the ferromagnetic debris from the EMAT face. The EMATs were water cooled to allow operation at elevated temperatures. The EMATs were used to generate shear waves and as the detector they were sensitive to both the shear and longitudinal waves. Both types of EMAT are capable of making ultrasound measurements on steel up to a temperature of about 800°C in pulse echo mode when the same EMAT was used for both generation and detection. A water cooled E-EMAT was used as the receiver of laser generated ultrasound. The system operated in send-receive arrangement where the EMAT is positioned on the generation side and measurement can be made from a single side has been made up to a temperature of lOOO°C. The measurement was carried out by using a Nd: VAG laser as the generator. The E-EMAT also has been used to receive ultrasound generated by a pulsed CO2 laser and could make ultrasound measurements up to a temperature of about 800°C. Besides; the laser-EMAT system was also used for epicentral measurements at elevated temperatures. Ultrasound measurements by a shear wave EMAT on ferromagnetic steel have been made using the shear wave arrivals in a range of temperature up to about 750°C where the EMAT is sensitive to both shear and longitudinal wave. Above this temperature however, ultrasound measurement was based on longitudinal wave arrivals as the EMAT is no longer sensitive to shear wave. At a temperature close to the Curie point, Te, of the sample, enhancement of longitudinal wave occurs. This may correspond to the reorientation and redistribution of the magnetic flux in a thin ferromagnetic layer on the bulk paramagnetic sample due to the cooling effect caused by the water-cooled EMAT or may be due to volume magnetostriction. We have monitored the magnetisation of the sample at elevated temperature and noted that the magnetisation of the sample reduces rapidly to zero as the temperature increases and approaches the Te' The cooling effect on hot samples caused by momentary contact with the water cooled EMATs was measured and shown to be minimal and superficial. The laser-EMAT ultrasound system could be used for thickness measurement on hot steels provided the velocity is known as a function of temperature. A series of measurements was carried out on steel samples in the laboratory to determine this data. The technique produces no significant damage to steel and has the potential of being rapidly scanned to test hot moving metals on the production line.	 Thesis or dissertation	 QC Physics	390244	0

 Living links and gender resources : the social construction of masculinities in teaching physical education	 Brown, David H. K.	 Loughborough University	 Loughborough University	2001	 This study is a conceptually driven exploration of the life worlds of male Physical Education teachers and the social construction of masculinity. Its focus is twofold: Firstly it asks questions of what gendered resources Physical Education teachers draw on in their teaching? How do they obtain and deploy these resources? What is their social significance? It asks these questions of a cohort of student male Physical Education teachers, as they pass through their teacher education year. Secondly, it asks how might we best represent these gendered masculine resources in social terms? Can we assemble alternative ways of articulating the masculine body-self-society complex in this context? The methodological approach is qualitative, social constructivist and employs a life history strategy. The participants were purposefully sampled and interviewed in depth, as they made the transition from student teacher to teacher. The study draws on the empirical data to illustrate and develop conceptual understandings of the problematic. In so doing, it highlights the social importance of remote and current gendered biography as a resource for action in teaching. These men's biographys are shown to link them to their gendered life experiences, which centre on a lifetime of successful involvement in the culturally dominant masculine arenas of sport and Physical Education. The linkages are expressed as a set of intellectual and embodied dispositions that provide the resources for action - the habitus. Furthermore, these men are shown to be sensitive to the presentation of their masculine selves and possess multiple masculinities, which they deploy according to their interpretations of the specific contexts in which theyfind themselves. The contention here is that the deployment and display ofparticular forms of masculinities are contingent on the possession of the necessary alternative resources in their habitus - which are very often missing. As a consequence, we see dominant masculine displays being drawn on as a default, or master identity in teaching. This perspective suggests implications for the social reconstruction of legitimatized gender ontologies being presented to children. The conclusion makes some conceptual suggestions on how we might use these insights to address the deficits in gendered resources that are available to these men and others like them, in order to allow them to express broader ranges of masculinities through their teaching.

 Social prescribing : the perspectives of service users, providers and prescribers	 White, Jane Mary	 Glasgow Caledonian University	 Glasgow Caledonian University	2012	Social prescribing aims to offer an alternative to pharmaceutical or psychological treatments for mild to moderate mental health problems that present in primary care. Social prescribing seeks to link people with community-based sources of support, which are provided outwith the traditional National Health Service (NHS). As such, it calls for collaborative working between three groups: service users, prescribers (health professionals), and providers of community-based activities. However, little is known about these stakeholders' perceptions of social prescribing as an acceptable and appropriate alternative care pathway. ~; ..• Drawing on the theory of social capital, this study aimed, firstly, to develop an understanding of the nature and potential of social prescribing as a means of health improvement. Secondly, it sought to identify factors that were likely to help or hinder' successful implementation. This qualitative, exploratory study adopted a case study methodology underpinned by a critical realist perspective. Three cases were selected purposively. Each was a community-based organisation offering activities which were being 'prescribed' by NHS health professionals. At each site, semi-structured interviews were carried out with a purposive sample of health professionals, service users and providers of the service (n=49). Findings indicate that service users were enthusiastic about the activities provided by the three community-based organisations. Processes of self-efficacy and social support appeared to have been facilitated by participatory person-centred relationships with service providers. These mechanisms were encouraged to operate by providers' creation of enabling contexts. Although challenges to the successful implementation of social prescribing were identified at individual, inter-personal, institutional and infra-structural levels, the findings suggest that social prescribing offers a promising alternative care pathway for people with mild to moderate mental health problems. It provides a holistic framework which, potentially, shifts the focus of care from an individual's deficiencies to their strengths, and from seeing people as passive recipients of services to active participants.

 Minimising vibration in a flexible golf club during robotic simulations of a golf swing	 Ellis, Kirsty	 Loughborough University	 Loughborough University	2014	Robots are widely used as substitutes for humans in situations involving repetitive tasks where a precise and repeatable motion is required. Sports technology is an area which has seen an increase in the implementation of robots which simulate specific human motions required for a sport. One purpose is to test sports equipment, where the requirement is for a motion to be performed with consistent variables. One issue which has arisen frequently in the robot simulation of humans is the inherent presence of vibration excited in a flexible object being manipulated by a robot, and this issue is not unfounded in the situation presented in this research, of a golf robot manipulating a flexible golf club during the simulation of a golf swing. It had been found that during robotic simulations of golf swings performed with the Miyamae Robo V at the Sports Technology Institute at Loughborough University, swing variables such as shaft deformation and clubhead orientation were dissimilar to those measured for human golf swings. Vibrations present in the golf club were identified as the key cause of the disparity between human and robot swing variables. This research sought to address this issue and find a method which could be applied to reduce clubhead vibrations present in robot simulations of a golf swing to improve their similarity to human swings. This would facilitate the use of the golf robot for equipment testing and club fitting. Golf swing variables were studied and measured for 14 human subjects with the aim being to understand the motion that the robot is required to simulate. A vibration damping gripper was then fitted to the robot to test the effect that changing the interface between the robot-excited vibrations and the club would have, this was achieved with a selection of silicone sleeves with differing material properties which could be attached to the club. Preliminary results showed a noticeable reduction in clubhead vibrations and this solution was investigated further. Mathematically modelling the robot was seen as the most suitable method for this as it meant the robot remained functional and allowed a number of solutions to be tested. Several iterations of a mathematical model were developed with the final model being structurally similar to the robot with the addition of a compliant grip and wrist. The method by which the robot is driven was also recognised as having a large effect on the level of vibration excited in the clubhead and the methodology behind generating smooth robot swing profiles is presented. The mathematical model was used to perform 6 swings and the resulting shaft deformation and clubhead vibration were compared with data from human swings. It was found that the model was capable of producing swing variables comparable to human swings, however in the downswing portion of the swing the magnitude of these variables were larger for the simulations. Simulations were made which sought to demonstrate the difference between the model replicating the rigid robot and a compliant system. Reductions in vibration were achieved in all swings, including those driven with robot feedback data which contains oscillations excited by the method with which the robot is driven.

 Iron-dependent regulation of gene expression in Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis	 Walker, Caray A.	 University of Glasgow	 University of Glasgow	2009	 This study set out to analyse C. pseudotuberculosis within an environment relevant to that which would be encountered within its natural host. The impact of the availability of iron within the growth environment of numerous bacteria has been widely reported, and an equivalent investigation was conducted to determine whether the same was true of C. pseudotuberculosis. To this end, a novel chemically-defined medium was designed, which supported the growth of C. pseudotuberculosis, but in which the concentration of specific growth factors could be manipulated. Subsequently, iron was shown to be essential for C. pseudotuberculosis growth, and analysis of secreted protein profiles revealed differential expression between low- and high-iron growth conditions. Furthermore, growth experiments conducted in the defined medium revealed that C. pseudotuberculosis is capable of obtaining iron from the host iron-binding proteins, transferrin and lactoferrin. The results presented in this thesis confirm the importance of iron to C. pseudotuberculosis, and reveal the existence of an iron-dependent regulator which is involved in regulating the expression of multiple target genes.

 Relinquishing knowing and reclaiming being : a heuristic self-search inquiry of becoming a counsellor through learning to tolerate uncertainty by reflecting on experiences in life, counselling practice and research	 Tweedie, Krista Lynne	 University of Edinburgh	 University of Edinburgh	2015	Previous research emphasises the importance of a counsellor’s ‘way of being’ in determining therapeutic effectiveness and outcome. The capacity to tolerate uncertainty is regarded as an important counsellor attribute. However, failing to show how counsellors learn this, limits the practical relevance of the existing literature for psychotherapy and counselling. This study questions how a counsellor can learn to bring his or her self more fully into relationship with clients and what the implications of this learning process on counselling work are. Central to this study is Levine’s (2002) conception that learning occurs through a willingness to think about experiences, which necessitates facing uncertainty. This thesis argues that the capacity to tolerate uncertainty is an individual learning process and a precondition for a counsellor developing his or her ‘way of being’ or therapeutic ‘use of self’ (Wosket, 1999). In this study, the counselling practitioner-researcher draws on her own learning process to show how reflection on personal issues triggered by experiences of uncertainty, that could obstruct a counsellor’s emotional availability necessary for ‘use of self’, may be a fundamental part of counsellor professional development. A learning process is demonstrated through reflection on five vignettes of experiences of uncertainty from life and counselling practice. Beginning with an inexplicable experience in counselling practice that the counsellor struggles to understand her response to, she wonders how her difficulty with tolerating uncertainty might relate to experiences of uncertainty and learned defences from her childhood and adolescence. Through an experience with a client’s overt uncertainty, the practitioner grasps the difference between trying to tolerate uncertainty and developing this capacity as a ‘way of being’. When creative and play work with a child client challenges use of the counsellor’s defences, her learning moves from a conceptual understanding to an embodied one. She becomes more present and vulnerable with clients allowing for connection with clients and greater depth in counselling work. The practitioner-researcher attributes this personal learning to the six phases of Sela Smith’s (2002) heuristic self-search inquiry that requires immersing in uncertainty, dwelling in the research question and accessing tacit knowledge. This study contributes to a lack of practical literature within psychotherapy and counselling on how counsellors develop their therapeutic ‘use of self’, a way of being that has been linked to effective therapeutic outcome yet only a small number of therapists possess. Although the process and findings of this subjective study cannot be generalised, it aims to stimulate each counsellors’ own reflection on therapeutic ‘use of self’. This study suggests a heuristic self-search framework for a counsellor to confront his or her own relationship to uncertainty as an integral part of professional development beyond what training can provide.

 Towards a discourse theory of abstracts and abstracting	 Gibson, Timothy Robin	 University of Nottingham	 University of Nottingham	1993	This Ph.D. thesis investigates the extent to which certain linguistic variables affect the perceived success of an abstract. In his opening chapter, the author situates the work as a contribution to discourse theory and formulates a set of seven basic research questions the study seeks to answer. Chapter 2 considers the most satisfactory design for the research. Part Two provides a survey of the relevant source material, consisting of reviews of: the Linguistics and Psychology literature; Artificial Intelligence computational summarising systems; and standards and guidelines taken from Information and Library Science. Part Three discusses the data collection: first, the collection of naturally occurring abstracts from a teaching establishment; second, the collection of judgements elicited by means of a set of questionnaires. The remainder of the thesis constitutes an attempt to reconcile these two types of data, words and opinions. The author draws a distinction between the qualitative and quantitative opinions of the judges (which he refers to as 'external measures') and the linguistic features present in the different abstracts ('internal measures') which determine these subjective opinions. Part Four discusses the data analysis, which draws on grammatical techniques from Systemic-Functional theory. In Part Four, hypotheses are investigated which relate the success of the different abstracts as perceived by the judges to the linguistic features present in the texts. Five different types of analysis are piloted using a small number of texts; three of these analyses are taken further and applied to all the abstracts. Part Five consists of two chapters. The first details the conclusions to be drawn from the study and explicitly answers the seven basic research questions introduced in Chapter 1. The second provides some suggestions for further research, chiefly concerning the collection of further external and internal measures. Finally, techniques from multivariate statistics are briefly sketched as a means of reconciling the two types of measure in the future. Abstract 2 This Ph.D. thesis investigates the extent to which certain linguistic variables affect the perceived success of an abstract. More specifically, answers to seven basic research questions are sought. These include: what reasons do readers give for preferring one abstract over another?; is 'success' better explained by correlation with one, or with many, linguistic variables?; to what extent do readers agree with each other in their various preferences? and which linguistic features can help to explain readers' preferences? In order to answer these questions, a total of 42 naturally occurring abstracts were collected from 29 second year Library and Information Science students at Brighton Polytechnic. 26 of these abstracts summarised General Knowledge source texts. 17 summarised Information Science (I.S.) source texts of three different types: journal articles, newspaper items and book chapters. The shortest I.S. abstract consisted of 111 words, the longest 651. Subjective data in the form of opinions of these abstracts were elicited by means of a set of six questionnaires. These questionnaires were administered to the students, to their two lecturers, and to 14 judges representing model consumers of such abstracts. The questionnaires elicited both quantitative and qualitative data. The 8 I.S. judges, for example, were asked to rank up to five different abstract versions summarising the same source text according to how helpful they believed them to be. They were also asked to provide reasons for their preferences. Different grammatical analyses from Systemic-Functional theory were employed to discover to what extent certain linguistic features in the abstracts determine their overall quality as perceived by the judges. Although some suggestions were made to overcome problems with the descriptive frameworks, analyses of generic structure and of cohesive harmony were found to be insufficiently reliable to enable precise hypothesis testing. However, the following linguistic phenomena were investigated more extensively and yielded interesting results: lexical texture; grammatical intricacy and choice of Theme. The answers to the above research questions are as follows. The reasons judges provide for preferring one abstract over another are many and varied; the two most common concern content and what might be termed 'reader-friendliness'. Success in text is a multivariate notion; anyone linguistic measure cannot explain all the variation in judges' preferences. Judges hold widely differing views of what constitutes a successful abstract: scores for Kendall's Coefficient of Concordance, W, a measure of inter-judge agreement, range from 0.109 to 0.597, suggesting that there are different drivers of success and that judges prioritise the importance of these drivers differently. In answer to the question, which linguistic features can help to explain readers' preferences?, the following results were obtained from the various hypotheses tested. Counter-intuitively, it was found that the more successful abstracts were characterised by lower levels of lexical density and were described as being 'clear'. Low levels of lexical density and lexical variation seem to be more the mark of 'reader-friendly' abstract writing, whereas higher levels of lexical density and lexical variation characterise abstracts which contain more information, but are correspondingly harder to process. In contrast to what is claimed in the literature, the hypothesis which stated that abstracts with a larger amount of clause level complexity would be generally preferred over abstracts with a smaller amount of clause level complexity was generally supported. Also, some clause combining strategies were noticeably preferred by the judges~ while others were noticeably dispreferred. However, these preferences were not shared across the different abstract sets. Judges were found to be particularly sensitive to choice of Theme. A new type of Theme was identified to complement the two already existing sub-types of topical Theme, interactional and informational: Themes are to be regarded as discoursal if they refer to aspects of the source material, or to studies which are themselves discussed by the source material. Eight hypotheses concerning choice of Theme were investigated. For example, hypothesis 8 claimed that abstracts with more informational Themes would be preferred over abstracts with fewer informational Themes. This was supported for the Tanzanian set (H8c), but falsified for the other three. The judges seem to be indicating that they deem an informational style to be more appropriate for the Tanzanian source text. The three different types of topical theme serve different functions: informational themes primarily reflect the writer's desire to enlighten, by presenting the raw facts of the message for readers' consideration; discoursal themes primarily reflect the writer's desire in orient their readers, by providing a way of navigating through the various channels in which the information is presented; interactional themes primarily reflect the writer's desire to make it easy for readers to integrate the knowledge, by showing readers how the information relates to the various people involved in its transfer.

 Does the use of diagnostic language affect causal beliefs related to mental health in non-qualified nursing and care staff?	 Bennett, Martin	 University of Liverpool	 University of Liverpool	2015	Attitudes and beliefs about mental health difficulties have important implications for people experiencing these difficulties. Research suggests that stereotypes and stigmatising views held by the public impact on the internalisation of these beliefs by people developing mental health difficulties, delaying help-seeking (Clement et al., 2015). For over 50 years research with the general public has sought to identify correlates of negative beliefs about mental ill health (Nunnally, 1961; Schomerus et al., 2012), and this area of research is increasingly seeking to ascertain the views of mental health workers. Meta-analyses have combined data on the general public to offer summaries of this work and offer interpretations based on the whole body of evidence reporting changing opinions over time, and demographic variables linked with more positive and negative attitudes (Angermeyer	 Thesis or dissertation	 BF Psychology	677545	0

 'A piecemeal way to save the world' : investigating social sustainability in the UK's conventional food supply	 Sharpe, Rosalind	 City, University of London	 City, University of London	2016	This thesis addresses a gap in knowledge of sustainability in relation to food – namely how the social ‘pillar’ is being interpreted and acted on, and by whom, in the UK’s conventional food supply. Sustainability is widely seen to have three pillars (environmental, economic and social), with the latter the least well understood. The thesis uses a governance perspective, where sustainability is viewed as a problem seen to be in need of intervention by public and other rule-making authorities. The research first reviewed UK-level state policy relating to social sustainability and food. It then explored organisational websites to find out what types of entity were active on social sustainability, and in what ways. The website research yielded data 135 separate entities, and was supplemented by 27 qualitative interviews. It was found that actors from a range of categories beyond companies producing food were involved in governing this area, such as financial actors, ‘infrastructure’ providers, consultants, advocacy groups and standards organisations. They used an array of governance techniques, including re-badging existing activities, outsourcing, advocacy, collaboration, and multiple forms of ‘audit’. The range of social concerns on which they acted was extensive, from nutrition and employment to education and animal welfare. They were both substantive (such as the nutritional content of food) and procedural (such as accountability). However, the activities were very inconsistently associated with sustainability, leading to the conclusion that social sustainability does not yet have a settled meaning in the context of the conventional food supply, and given the highly normative nature of its constituent concerns, its meaning may always be dynamic and contested. Overall, non-state governance was found to be ad hoc and opportunistic, but also resourceful and idealistic. In the absence of coherent state guidance, it served the actors’ diverse interests rather than any agreed public goal.	 Thesis or dissertation	 H Social Sciences (General)	716097	0
 Keeping up with technologies : revisiting the meaning and role of Internet access in digital inclusion	 Grošelj, Darja	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2015	The ways people go online have been transformed by the emergence of new mobile Internet technologies. As modes of Internet access are becoming increasingly diverse, this thesis sets out to examine how various forms of access shape engagement with online resources. Inequalities in Internet access have been neglected in the "second-level digital divide" research, which has focused on differences in skills and usage. Thus, I argue that inequalities of access have to be revisited and their role in digital inclusion reassessed. To study individuals' arrangements of Internet-enabled devices and locations holistically and as a dynamic entity, access is conceptualised as infrastructure. Theoretically, I distinguish between material dimensions of access and social practices shaping access, and draw on existing models of digital inclusion to examine the role of these dimensions and practices in online engagement. Empirically, a mixed methods research design is employed, complementing longitudinal analyses of survey data representative of the British population with 29 qualitative interviews with British Internet users. This study contributes to our understanding of material and social dimensions of access and their impact on Internet use patterns. First, the conceptualisation of Internet access as infrastructure is empirically validated. Second, quality, locality and ubiquity are established as material dimensions of access, where offline social and economic resources most strongly affect inclusion in high-quality, multi-local and ubiquitous Internet access. Third, three specific practices encompassing how users develop and maintain their access infrastructures are identified: spotlighting, distributing and being stranded. They reflect differences in roles Internet technologies play in individuals' daily lives as well as differences in availability of offline resources. Fourth, the results show that, controlling for a range of digital inclusion factors, the access inequalities have significant effects on a range of online engagement types, but are most strongly related to commercial and communication uses of the Internet. In sum, this study provides a nuanced understanding of how different mechanisms underlie the development, maintenance and engagement with Internet access, depending on whether access arrangements are shaped by digital exclusion or choice. Specifically, by outlining critical differences among all-round, mobile-mostly, mobile-only and home-only Internet users, broader policy and research implications are also discussed.

 The development of Chinese metropolitan planning management systems : with particular focus upon governance	 Wang, Yong	 University of South Wales	 University of South Wales	2015	This thesis examines Chinese metropolitan planning management system taking lessons from its past as well as current development and involving recommendations for its future improvement. It investigates the historical and current developments in the metropolitan planning management systems and also makes recommendations about how to improve the future systems. It aims to find potential ways which can make the Chinese metropolitan planning management system work well and move the metropolitan planning management to good governance. This thesis also constructs a theoretical framework from the perspective of decentralization, focusing upon the change of relationships between the Chinese government, market and society, to gain an in-depth insight of changes in the development of Chinese planning management system since 1978. It considers a case study approach to analyze the current situation of the metropolitan planning management system. It employs a qualitative research methodology that comprises of questionnaire and interviews with governmental officials, planners and experts, to study the behaviors of different actors involved in the core operations of planning management system, and investigate relationships between the government, market and society in order to examine the fundamental institutional factors producing the problems. In the end, on basis of the global public management paradigm transformation and in view of the overall trend of the governance transition, it makes recommendations regarding an improved metropolitan planning management system in China. It identifies factors influencing the Chinese metropolitan planning management system. It argues that the planning management system changes with the administrative system. The administrative management system reform has become the most direct and fundamental motive for promoting the transition of planning management system. It scrutinizes the problems in metropolitan planning management system. It argues that inadequate modern bureaucracy is the primary characteristic of current planning management systems, which is inducing problems in the metropolitan planning management system. It argues that the focus of Chinese metropolitan planning management system reform is the allocation of power and responsibility among different interest groups. It argues that reform of the metropolitan planning management system needs continuous improvement and has to surpass the bureaucracy moderately. The essence of metropolitan planning management system reform is rationalizing relationships between different levels of governments as well as relationships between the government, market and society. It insists that improved metropolitan planning management system in China needs support from other governance tools.

 The Supreme Court of the United States and the right to vote	 Lardy, Heather	 University of Aberdeen	 University of Aberdeen	1994	This thesis considers some conceptual problems in the constitutional voting rights doctrine of the U.S. Supreme Court. The court has expanded its theory of voting rights to cover matters other than the right of suitably qualified individuals to register and cast a ballot. The thesis considers the manner in which the Court has extended its theory. Chapters 2 and 3 discuss the Court's decision on votor registration and franchise laws. Chapters 4 and 5 deal with the application of voting rights doctrine to electoral districting disputes. Chapter 6 considers the problems raised by attempts to extend the reach of the doctrine to claims that certain forms of electoral structure dilute the voting power of racial (or other) minority groups. The subject of Chapter 7 is the right to be a candidate and the relationship between that right and the right to vote. Chapter 8 contains a short treatment of the Court's complex decisions on laws regulating election campaign spending, and considers the compatibility of the theory on which those decisions are based with the Court's broader constitutional voting rights doctrine. This broad survey of the Court's voting rights decisions is undertaken with the aim of highlighting inconsistencies in its characterisation of the constitutional right to vote. It is concluded (Chapter 9) that the Court has repeatedly retreated behind a limited conception of the right to vote as a right to register and cast a ballot, and to be protected against the various forms of voting-related discrimination which the Constitution explicitly prohibits. Possible explanations for the Court's preference for a narrow conception of the right to vote are considered in the text.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Constitution	260269	0

 Young homeless people and urban space : displacements, mobilities and fixity	 Jackson, Emma	 Goldsmiths College (University of London)	 Goldsmiths College (University of London)	2010	This thesis is an investigation into youth homelessness and its spaces in contemporary London. As an issue, homelessness has often been equated with the category of the street homeless individual and the place of the street. Arguing that existing approaches do not capture the complexity of youth homelessness in the multicultural city, this thesis offers an alternative analytical framework based on an exploration of space as dynamic and processes of mobility, fixity and displacement. A multi-method project conducted in a day centre for young homeless people in central London, this research explores participants' lives and daily trajectories, the systems in which young homeless people are implicated and the survival tactics they practise within them. In framing the day centre as a place of the displaced the thesis provides a different angle on how movement makes city space, foregrounding types and scales of displacement where movement is shaped by loss and violence. The research explores not only the `global in the local' (Massey: 1993) but the other shorter forms of displacements and daily movements that also make urban spaces. A range of spaces of homelessness - including the street, the hostel, the day centre - are explored revealing both the kinds of surveillance that shape participants' pathways and the place-making tactics (de Certeau: 1988) that are practised within them. The thesis argues that young homeless people are fixed in mobility a condition that impacts on both everyday life and possible futures. It examines how the enmeshing of systems, the presence of persistent pasts and the lack of tangible imagined futures suspends these young people in a precarious present.

The experience of peripheral regions in an age of industrialisation : the case of Devon, 1840-1914	 Finch, Greg P.	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	1984	This thesis addresses the unresolved question of whether industrialisation helps or hinders progress in the peripheral regions of developing economies. Devon is seen as a 'sample of space' within which the breaking down of regional identities by changes in the Victorian transport infrastructure can be monitored. As the county's fortunes were thus primarily dependent upon the course of development in the wider national economy the survey of changes in economic activity within Devon is concerned mainly with relating internal adjustments to external pressures and opportunities. The balance of these appears to have resulted in a demand 'leakage* from the county's economy, and a net outwards flow of migrants, for there was a chronic deficit in Devon's balance of payments with the rest of Britain. This was probably exacerbated by an outflow of capital. But the relative contraction of employment within the county took a selective form in accordance with the developing specialisation of activity across the' national economic space. On the evidence of comparative wages in agriculture it seems that direct external demand was of central importance to the elimination of spatial differentials after 1870. But for the county as a whole there was no narrowing of the large shortfall between local wages and the national average before 1914. Sectors that benefited from external demand were few in number and their linkages with the rest of Devon's economy were too weak to stimulate general growth in the county, and the relatively unchanging distribution of demand throughout the nation that this refle-cted helped to maintain residual regional barriers to internal adjustment. The British economy was mature enough to pull the least developed regions away from pre-industrial levels of poverty but there was no inherent tendency to eliminate the broad tail which lagged behind the cutting edge of industrialisation.

 Impact of climatic variability on the fire behaviour of different land ecosystems	 Viegas de Barros, Ana Lúcia	 University of Edinburgh	 University of Edinburgh	2011	Wildfires are a natural phenomenon that strongly impacts the environment. Many terrestrial ecosystems depend on fire to maintain their ecological equilibrium and biodiversity, but new destructive fire patterns, often associated with land management practices and rapid climate change, have been degrading soil and water resources, increasing erosion by wind, precipitation and floods, decreasing biodiversity and contributing to desertification. Furthermore, pyrogenic emissions from biomass burning are an important source of atmospheric pollution and they impact the radiative balance of the troposphere, strongly contributing to the greenhouse effect. The objective of this research was to investigate the impact of climate variability on geographic, ecological, seasonal and inter-annual distributions of fires and correspondent pyrogenic emissions, across a variety of ecosystems. With this purpose, 10 years of world, monthly, 1°x1° gridded data, from the Global Fire Emissions Database, were compared with land-cover data, from the Goddard Institute of Space Studies, and with weather data, from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre and the Global Hydrology Resource Centre. Overall, the climate parameters significantly correlated with carbon emissions were air and soil temperature, air and soil humidity, rainfall, wind speed and lightning density during the fire season, and also precipitation and snow cover up to 6 months before the fire season. Good statistical quantitative models of carbon emissions (correlations above 70%, and up to 95%, between estimated and predicted values, with residuals normally distributed) using humidity, temperature or lagged rainfall as predictors, were found almost exclusively in tropical grasslands, shrublands and woodlands, especially in Africa, where fire behaviour was more regular. In boreal and temperate forests and woodlands, where fire patterns were irregular and fire returning periods were larger, there were not enough fires, in 10 years of data, to obtain useful predictive statistical models. The fire models presented here, together with the quantitative statistical relationships found between climate and fire patterns, in different land ecosystems, are apt to be used in predictive climate models, land management, fire risk assessment and mitigation of climate change.

 Clandestine migration and the business of bordering Europe	 Andersson, Ruben	 London School of Economics and Political Science (University of London)	 London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)	2012	Irregular, clandestine or so-called “illegal” migration by land and sea is rarely out of the political and media agenda in Europe despite its statistically limited significance. Taking this mismatch as its starting point, this thesis explores the industry that has emerged around clandestine migration in recent years – the transnational policing networks, aid organisations and media outlets that all make the “illegal immigrant” their target, beneficiary and source. It focuses on the migration circuit between West Africa and Spain, where a joint European response to irregular flows was first tried and tested under the umbrella of the border agency Frontex. It is also here that success in “fighting illegal migration” has been most readily announced following the brief, spectacular migration “crises” in Spain’s North African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla in 2005 and in the Canary Islands in 2006. The thesis explores ethnographically how clandestine migration has been constituted as a field of intervention and knowledge-gathering since this time. In this field, it is argued, the roles of policing, caring for and informing on migrants intermingle while producing shared models, materialities and classifications that impinge upon the travellers labelled “illegal”. Drawing on the dynamic nominalism of Ian Hacking, the actor-network theory of Bruno Latour and a growing body of critical migration and border studies, the thesis explores the interfaces where specific modalities of migrant illegality are produced. The exploration of these interfaces – in deportation, surveillance, patrolling, rescues, reception and activism – relies on an extended field site, with research carried out in Senegal, Mali, Morocco, southern Spain and European policing headquarters. Throughout, the thesis highlights not just the workings of the migration industry but this industry’s excesses and absurdities, which make the business of bordering Europe a fraught and contradictory enterprise.

 A structuralist examination of the origins of the Māra Mytheme and its function in the narrative of the Dàoxíng Bōrě Jīng, the earliest complete recension of the Aṣṭasāhasrikā-prajñā-pāramitā-sūtra	 Giddings, William James	 King's College London (University of London)	 King's College London	2014	 By comparing the instances of the Māra mytheme in the narratives of the prajñāpāramitā-sūtras with those found in non-Mahayana texts, this thesis explores how this vitally important persona, one central to the narrative account of the bodhisattva quest for awakening, developed from earlier mythic prototypes. Pali sources identify a number of alternative identities for Māra the most significant of which being Namuci, an asura who took control over the mind of Indra. Using linguistic ideas originally developed by Saussure, the storylines of the Māra and Namuci myths can be reduced to a simple, common narrative statement or syntagm. Adopting this approach demonstrates how apparently new narratives can be derived through the application of paradigmatic changes within that syntagm. Furthermore, drawing upon the findings of historical linguistics, it was possible to interpolate potential Proto-Indian-European origins for the Māra mytheme. Rather than supporting the traditionally accepted view of Māra as an allegory for death, this enabled the signification of the actual name Māra to be seen as pointing towards a ‘grinding-away’ or oppression of the mind. This was achieved by relating the Māra of Buddhist mythology with the mare-hag common to a number of Indo- European folklores. Support for this argument is also found in Pali narratives which depict Māra entering the thoughts of others engaged in meditation during the night in order to induce feelings of fear and uncertainty. Finally, based upon these findings, it was possible to scrutinize the narrative and nested tales of the Aṣṭasāhasrikā-prajñā-pāramitā-sūtra in its earliest recension, the Dàoxíng Bōrě Jīng, and identify how the original Māra myth underwent structured, paradigmatic modifications that reflect a bodhisattva’s progress towards final awakening.

 The effects of solvent changes and of electrolyte additions on the stabilities of initial and transition states in nucleophilic substitution reactions	 Jackson, E.	 Durham University	 Durham University	1966	This thesis describes the effects of solvent changes and electrolyte additions on the stabilities of the initial and transition states in the solvolysis (or ionisation) of organic chlorides. Very little relevant information was available when the present work began, but many workers (^1b, 32,42,43,50a,e,f,j.) had studied the effects of changes in the reaction conditions on the rate coefficient. The present experiments were carried out in aqueous acetone using 4-phenyl:4'-nitrodiphenylmethyl chloride (I),4-nitrodiphenylmethyl chloride (II) and 4-nitrobenzylchloride (III) as substrates. Compound (III) undergoes S(_N)2 solvolysis, while (I) and (II) react entirely by the unimolecular mechanism, S(_N)l.(^17,86.) The rate of solvolysis of compound (III) was less sensitive to solvent changes than that of compounds (I) and (II); in agreement with earlier views. (^1) In bimolecular solvolysis, compound (III), an increase in the water content reduced the stability of both the initial and transition states, though not to the same extent. However, the stability of the transition state in S(_N)l reactions was almost independent of the solvent composition, although this did not apply to the corresponding entropy and enthalpy terms. These results show some differences from those obtained from a study of the effects of solvent changes in the solvolysis of tert.-butyl chloride in aqueous ethanol. (^31, 55b, g, 85.) The effects of added electrolytes on the rate of ionisation of compound (III) in 70% (v/v) aqueous acetone depended markedly on their nature, in agreement with other recent reports of specific electrolyte effects.(^50) In general, the stability of the initial state was more sensitive to the nature of the electrolyte than the stability of the transition state. These results are qualitatively consistent with the view that two separate effects control the stabilities of these two states, and hence the rate: the ionic-strength effect,(^1) which is independent of the nature of the electrolyte and the salt-induced medium effect. (^50a, e., 58) The magnitude of the latter effect depends on the nature of the electrolyte, since it can be considered to arise from changes in the "effective" solvent composition caused by the varying degrees of solvation of different electrolytes. The smaller sensitivity of the transition state to the nature of the electrolyte is then consistent with its virtually constant stability as the composition of solvent is altered.

 Where does bullying exist in children's everyday experiences of school?	 Nassem, Elizabeth	 University of Huddersfield	 University of Huddersfield	2012	The aim of this research is to examine, from children’s perspectives, where bullying exists in their everyday experiences of school. A Foucauldian perspective is used to conceptualise bullying and perceives it as involving power which is fluid and involves struggles between individuals. Different modalities of bullying are examined (between pupils, between teachers and pupils and systemic bullying). This research also investigates different severities of bullying from clear to ‘grey’; and different perspectives and feelings children have. Traditional definitions are challenged which distinguish bullying as a specific form of aggression, experienced by a minority of people. Observations, focus groups and individual interviews were conducted with children in five state schools, a private school and a pupil referral unit, 84 children in total were interviewed. This research found that although most children experienced characteristics of bullying such as name-calling and humiliation, which often caused them distress, few children considered it as bullying and no-one referred to themselves as a bully. Teachers were subject to powers of normalisation and panopticism where they were under surveillance to ensure children conformed to education norms. Although bullying was found to be multi-causal, a particular finding in this thesis is the role played by boredom. Working-class boys with learning difficulties were particularly under ‘the gaze’ and increasingly targeted for punishment, which usually increased their boredom. Some of these children wanted revenge and engaged in bullying. Because they often felt increasingly targeted for punishment, they also experienced bullying by teachers and systemic bullying. Another reason children bully is to be popular and exercise social power over others. This research is an original contribution to knowledge because of its complex and multi-faceted understanding of bullying. These findings have wider resonance and are likely to apply where these processes occur, for example, in other schools.	 Thesis or dissertation	 L Education (General)	571567	0

 Helping the man in the middle : assessing and training referee performance	 Mascarenhas, D. R. D.	 University of Edinburgh	 University of Edinburgh	2005	Using a multi-modal approach, the first investigation used referee performance profiling, three sources of RFU literature together with academic literature to establish the key areas of referee performance. The Cornerstones Performance Model emerged, overarched by the psychological characteristics of excellence and featuring knowledge and application of the law; contextual judgment; personality and management skills; and fitness, positioning and mechanics. The model was subsequently adopted by the RFU to guide the support, development and selection of the English RFU referees. As the model reflects, referee performance largely hinges upon their decision-making. Consequently, a thorough review of decision-making literature revealed a relatively new paradigm for exploring high-pressure decisions, in environments such as refereeing, known as naturalistic decision making (NDM). Therefore, adopting a naturalistic approach, 45 referees, 47 touch-judges, 27 assessors and 13 referee coaches made immediate decisions on 10 videotaped tackle incidents of real game scenarios. Examination of the decisions and the reasons underpinning them revealed surprisingly low levels of accuracy amongst all groups. Given such apparently low scores, a referee coherence training programme was designed, in order to reinforce accurate interpretations. Over a six-week period an experimental group studied training tapes consisting of 5 sets of 5 tackles, in each case with an expert providing his interpretation of the correct decision. All groups improved their performance with the lowest ranked referees significantly improving their performance at the posttest. These results suggest that such shared mental model training is an appropriate method for improving referee decision-making. However as the referee performance model presents, referee decision-making is influenced by many factors beyond a simple application of the law. Accordingly, the final investigation explored how the context of the game influences rugby-union referees management of the game. Following the nominal group technique, two groups of referees listed any contextual factors that they felt might affect their decisions during a game. Individual ratings of this list with both groups revealed the most important factors to be the ‘temper of the game,’ ‘the level of player respect/rapport,’ ‘position on pitch,’ ‘scoreline,’ and the ‘time left in the game.’ To verify these factors a think-aloud protocol was conducted with three international referees, assessing how they weight their decisions based on the context and how this affects their management of the game. The results suggest that ‘preventative refereeing is a crucial aspect of referee performance. This research program highlights the need for empirically based interventions in order to assist in the monitoring and training of high performance referees.	 Thesis or dissertation	796,077	657399	0

The policy of the United States towards Cuba from 1989-1996	 Gibbs, J. F.	 University of Cambridge	 University of Cambridge	2005	In the immediate post-Cold War period, as the security rationale for the U.S. embargo disappeared, the United States tightened rather than eased sanctions on Cuba. This dissertation focuses on the competition between Congress and the executive for control of policy towards Cuba, and the domestic interests which shaped policymaking and led to the passage of two major pieces of legislation fiercely resisted by U.S. allies. The dissertation begins with an analysis of U.S. policy towards Cuba in the summer of 1989, before the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe. Five days of congressional hearings called by Representative George Crockett (D.Michigan) in his attempt to spark a reassessment of relations between the two countries form the basis for a review of policy over the preceding thirty years. The first chapter will also introduce the Cuban American National Foundation, the pre-eminent domestic interest group in U.S. policy towards Cuba in 1989-1996, and the U.S. campaign to have Cuba condemned for human rights violations at the United Nations Human Right Commission. The second chapter examines the policy debate in 1989-1992, focusing on the provision of information to Cubans, the intensification of economic sanctions, and the continuation of the human rights campaign. The third chapter analyses the role of migration from Cuba to the United States between 1959-1992, arguing the main objective of U.S. policy. Chapter four looks at continuity and change under the Clinton administration, and in particular at the administration’s handling of the rafter (migration) crisis of 1994 and the resulting agreements reached with the Cuban government. The primary focus of the fifth chapter will be the struggle between the executive and Congress over the Helms-Burton legislation, signed by Clinton in March 1996.	 Thesis or dissertation	970	599383	0
 Synthesis and conformational analysis of fluorinated pyrrolidines	 Combettes, Lorraine Eugenie Aurelie	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2012	The aim of this thesis was to investigate the synthesis and the conformational analysis of fluorinated pyrrolidines. We focused on two strategies namely, the iodoamination and fluoroamination of fluorinated precursors. Iodoamination Our first approach for the synthesis of fluorinated pyrrolidines relied on the iodocyclisation of allylic fluorides bearing pendant nitrogen nucleophiles. These allylic fluorides were obtained by fluorodesilylation of suitably functionalised allylsilanes. After validation of this methodology, the scope and limitations of the iodoamination were investigated. Furthermore, we were able to probe the influence of the fluorine moiety on the level of diastereocontrol of the cyclisation. Fluoroamination The second route focused on a key reaction: an unprecedented electrophilic fluoroamination of an aminated allylsilane. From a mechanistic point of view, the presence of the silyl group act as a 1,2-dipole and activate the double bond towards electrophilic fluorination. This methodology required the initial screening of a silyl directing group that would promote electrophilic addition, without subsequent desilylation. Finally, we investigated the level of diastereocontrol displayed by these cyclisations as a function of the E/Z geometry of the starting aminated allylsilane. Conformational analysis Moreover the 3-fluoropyrrolidines obtained via iodoamination served to investigate the stereoelectronic influence of the fluorine gauche effect on ring conformations. Solid state single crystal X-ray analysis and solution phase NMR spectroscopy were used for this purpose. Due to complicated conformational analysis of saturated five-membered rings in solution, 1D 19F-1H heteronuclear nOe (HOESY) experiments have been optimised for applications to this type of small molecules. These have been employed to estimate 19F-1H internuclear distances and were combined with vicinal 3JFH and 3JHH scalar coupling constants in order to analyse the ring conformations.

 Are illness representations of individuals living with Chronic Kidney Disease predictive of levels of physical activity and associated to depression?	 Nah, Ryan Guo Quan	 University of Leicester	 University of Leicester	2017	 The Common Sense Model (CSM) of illness representations is a prominent psychological approach used to understand the motivation behind health behaviours. This thesis sought to understand the utility of the CSM by examining the relationship between facets of illness representations and health behaviours in individuals with Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Literature Review: CVD confers significant costs, which is mitigated by a physically active lifestyle. However, many CVD patients do not undertake sufficient exercise. This prompted studies to examine if illness representations underpin the motivation behind such health behaviours. Despite a growing body of research in this area, no review has systematically interrogated and synthesised the corpus of research evidence. The current review aims to systematically review the relationship between illness representations and indices of physical activity in CVD. Ten studies were elicited with overall findings being equivocal; the majority of the studies demonstrated a relationship between illness representations and indices of physical activities with domains of timeline, control and consequences of the CSM most often revealed associations. Future research exploring putative causal relationships between illness representations and indices of physical activity is warranted. Empirical Study: CKD is a debilitating condition, which is further exacerbated by depression. While being physically active have scope to mitigate adverse impacts, many do not meet the recommended physical activity guideline. The current study examined the relationship between illness representations and levels of physical activity in CKD. Seventy non-dialysing patients were recruited from an outpatient renal clinic. Results indicated that timeline cyclical of the CSM predicted levels of physical activity and was not moderated or mediated by depression while timeline cyclical, consequences, emotional representations, personal control and illness coherence were significantly associated with depression. Future research regarding the development of psychological interventions based on an illness representations framework is proposed.	 Thesis or dissertation	 dc_subject:: @@MISSING-DATA	724442	0

The metabolism of beta-(3,4 dihydroxyphenyl)-L-alanine by plants	 Andrews, R. S.	 Royal Holloway, University of London	 University of London	1967	Methods for the detection and characterisation of DOPA derivatives in plant tssues have been investigated. In relation to this study, several methods for the production of possible naturally occurring derivatives were explored. The most success was achieved by feeding L-DOPA to Pislum sativum seeds which were then allowed to germinate for a short periods. Five compounds were isolated from the treated seedlings and one of them was shown to be identical to the DOPA glucoside which had previously been reported in the testas of broad been (Vicia faba) seeds (5). The same compound was later identified in the cotyledons of dormant bean seeds, and its structure shown to be B - (3-B-D - glucopyranosyloxy) - 4 - hydroxyphenyl) - L - alanine. The chemical nature of the other compounds was also investigated and tentative deductions made for their structures. A number of 0 and N - methylated derivatives of DOPA have been synthesised chemically. Their properties have been recorded and whereby isomeric 0 - substituted DOPA derivatives may be distinguished are outlined. Using the information from the preliminary studies, the distribution of DOPA and its derivatives in about 200 different species of plants have been investigated. This has revealed that DOPA derivatives are rare in plants, although free DOPA has been detected in a number of leguminous species and in species grouped within the order of Centrospermae. This latter discovery adds weight to the suggestion that DOPA is a precursor of the characteristic red-violet and yellow pigments which are found within the Centroapermae. A detailed study the distribution of DOPA and related compounds in the broad bean has been undertaken. Variations in the concentrations of the compounds throughout the growth cycle have been studied qualitatively using chromatographic and electrophoretic techniques, and quantatively, using an iodine colourimetric procedure and by ran exchange chromatography. The presence of DOPA in the tissues of leguminous species is often associated with the formation of dark brown or black pigments. Observations on the biogenesis, histology and chemical nature of these pigments are described. Comparison of the chemical and physical properties of plant pigments with those of biosynthetically prepared melanins showed that there are considerable differences. The plant pigments do not appear to be similar to animal melanins. The enzyme in dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) leaves which catalyses the deamination of DOPA has been studied. This appears to be labile, particulate and distinct from the phenylalanine ammonia lyase which is also present in the leaves.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Organic Chemistry	703994	0

 The role of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus in the central control of the autonomic nervous system	 Feetham, Claire	 University of Liverpool	 University of Liverpool	2014	The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is a region of the hypothalamus considered the “master controller” of the autonomic nervous system. A subregion of the PVN, the parvocellular subnucleus, is believed to be involved in autonomic control, but its physiological importance is not fully understood. This thesis aimed to investigate the role of the parvocellular PVN in autonomic control and the underlying mechanisms responsible. In slice cell-attached patch action current recordings showed that putative parvocellular neurones are sensitive to osmolality and that a member of the mechanosensitive transient receptor potential ion channel (TRP) family TRPV4 plays a role in this osmosensing. TRPV4 agonists gave a similar reduction in action current frequency (ACf) to hypotonic challenge, which was reversed by selective TRPV4 inhibitors. Single-channel recordings identified a TRP-like channel on parvocellular neurones, and the activity of this channel was increased by the TRPV4 agonist 4αPDD. Intracellular calcium recordings showed increases in Ca2+ in response to either hypotonic challenge or 4αPDD. Furthermore, a role for TRPV4 was verified in central osmosensing at the whole animal level; central injections of hypotonic solution decreased blood pressure; an effect ablated by a TRPV4 inhibitor. Functional coupling between TRPV4 channels and Ca2+-activated K+ (KCa) channels was also explored. The effect of hypotonic challenge was reversed by inhibition of the small-conductance KCa (SK) channel. Since the effects of TRPV4 could also be blocked by an SK inhibitor, it is proposed that TRPV4 is coupled to SK to modulate neuronal activity. During calcium recordings Aaplication of a TRPV4 agonist in the presence of an SK inhibitor showed a reduced, but sustained Ca2+ rise compared to TRPV4 agonist application alone, suggesting feedback mechanisms are also in play. These mechanisms were also verified, quantitatively, with a mathematical model written in the NEURON simulation environment and incorporating experimentally derived parameters. A role for this area of the PVN in temperature sensing was also discovered, with ACf decreasing with an increase in temperature from 25oC to 37oC. Pharmacological investigation identified another TRP channel, TRPM2, to be central for the PVN response to temperature. ECG recordings from rats implanted with telemeters confirmed roles for neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1) expressing neurones in the PVN in the cardiovascular response to psychological stress and in the setting of circadian heart rate. Heart rate variability analysis showed that increases in the sympathetic activity indicator, “LF/HF”, in response to handling stress were ablated by specific lesioning of the NK1 neurones in the PVN. In addition these animals had a significant shift in the daily variation of their average day/night heart rate. In conclusion this thesis identifies the mechanisms underlying several different functional roles for parvocellular PVN neurones and indicates the PVN may be a multifunctional homeostatic “detector”.

 The archaeology of pilgrimage on the Camino de Santiago de Compostela, Spain : a landscape perspective	 Candy, Julie M.	 University of Glasgow	 University of Glasgow	2007	 Theoretical perspectives on landscape and bodily engagement with place inform an approach to the medieval pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. Focused primarily, but not exclusively, on the central Middle Ages, this research confronts two core questions: how did transient, mobile groups perceive and experience the diverse terrain of the pilgrim route in northern Spain? And how may their ephemeral presence be traced in the archaeological record? This thesis is underpinned by the conviction that the journey of medieval pilgrims, as opposed to their destination, deserves greater scrutiny. Three topographically distinct Study Areas along the length of the Camino in Navarre, Burgos and Galicia from the basis for the analysis of localised sets of material culture. Within these areas, historical and geographical information, surviving monuments and structures, and a fieldwork plan designed to engage with the processes of making a linear journey, combine to form data-sets from which to tackle more refined contextual research questions. The main thrust of my argument is that large numbers of pilgrims were heavily influenced by contemporary medieval narrative tradition in which landscape was a powerful metaphor for religious meaning, experience and deportment. Material culture along the Camino speaks volumes about a powerful “culture of the route”, ritual performances, thresholds, transitions, and social relations across landscapes. The sum of evidence indicates a radical impact on local landscapes with some sectors of the community benefiting from the unfolding movement while others appear to distance themselves from the perpetual stream of pilgrims.

 The epidemiology of foot-and-mouth disease at the wildlife-livestock interface in northern Tanzania	 Casey-Bryars, Miriam	 University of Glasgow	 University of Glasgow	2016	Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), a disease of cloven hooved animals caused by FMD virus (FMDV), is one of the most economically devastating diseases of livestock worldwide. The global burden of disease is borne largely by livestock-keepers in areas of Africa and Asia where the disease is endemic and where many people rely on livestock for their livelihoods and food-security. Yet, there are many gaps in our knowledge of the drivers of FMDV circulation in these settings. In East Africa, FMD epidemiology is complicated by the circulation of multiple FMDV serotypes (distinct antigenic variants) and by the presence of large populations of susceptible wildlife and domestic livestock. The African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) is the only wildlife species with consistent evidence of high levels of FMDV infection, and East Africa contains the largest population of this species globally. To inform FMD control in this region, key questions relate to heterogeneities in FMD prevalence and impacts in different livestock management systems and to the role of wildlife as a potential source of FMDV for livestock. To develop FMD control strategies and make best use of vaccine control options, serotype-specific patterns of circulation need to be characterised. In this study, the impacts and epidemiology of FMD were investigated across a range of traditional livestock-keeping systems in northern Tanzania, including pastoralist, agro-pastoralist and rural smallholder systems. Data were generated through field studies and laboratory analyses between 2010 and 2015. The study involved analysis of existing household survey data and generated serological data from cross-sectional livestock and buffalo samples and longitudinal cattle samples. Serological analyses included non-structural protein ELISAs, serotype-specific solid-phase competitive ELISAs, with optimisation to detect East African FMDV variants, and virus neutralisation testing. Risk factors for FMDV infection and outbreaks were investigated through analysis of cross-sectional serological data in conjunction with a case-control outbreak analysis. A novel Bayesian modeling approach was developed to infer serotype-specific infection history from serological data, and combined with virus isolation data from FMD outbreaks to characterise temporal and spatial patterns of serotype-specific infection. A high seroprevalence of FMD was detected in both northern Tanzanian livestock (69%, [66.5 - 71.4%] in cattle and 48.5%, [45.7-51.3%]	 Thesis or dissertation	SF600 Veterinary Medicine	700312	0
 Factors affecting chromosome copy number and nuclear organisation in human sperm and embryos	 Fonseka, K. Gothami Lakshika	 University of Kent	 University of Kent	2012	Chromosome copy number aberrations are a leading cause of birth defects, stillbirths, pregnancy loss and infertility. Every human male has a proportion of chromosomally abnormal sperm however conditions such as infertility, cancer, cancer treatments, and environmental factors can increase this. Chromosome abnormality is commonplace in human embryos and one reason for the development of the controversial preimplantation genetic screening CPOS). Factors such as embryo quality and maternal age are cornmon correlates. Appropriate nucleus positioning of chromosome territories is also though to be indicative of a "healthy" nucleus with aberrations in such nuclear organization associated with disease. The purpose of this study was to provide insight into the relationship between chromosome copy number, nuclear organization and various aetiological factors in human sperm and early stage embryos. Specifically. • To investigate the nuclear positioning oftelomeric and sub telomeric region in sperm cells and test the hypothesis that such organisation is altered in infertile males. • To investigate the nuclear positioning of centromeric and locus specific regions of 5 chromosomes in sperm cells from males undergoing chemotherapeutic treatment for testicular cancer and Hodgkin's lymphoma and test the hypothesis that either the cancer, or its treatment significantly alters patterns of nuclear organization. • To analyse FISH based PGS and "follow up" in 250 treatment cycles to investigate levels of aneuploidy false negative and positive results, also well as effects of different indications such as maternal age. • To investigate the levels of aneuploidy for all 24 chromosomes using a newly developed multicolour FISH technique. To test hypotheses that factors e.g. maternal age and embryo morphology significantly effect levels, and that day 3 and day 5 results are concordant. • To assess levels nuclear organisation of human embryos for loci on all 24 chromosomes and their relationship to maternal age, day 3 and day 5 embryo morphology. Overall, results provide some evidence for differences in nuclear organisation in infertile males compared to controls for telomeric but not sub-telorneric loci. Effects of cancer (testicular cancer and Hodgkin's lymphoma) and chemotherapy were subtle at best with one testicular cancer patient showing a significant difference compared to controls. In embryos, monosomy appeared more common that trisomy and effects of maternal age and embryo quality were apparent when a small subset of chromosomes were analysed. Similar analysis with a 24 FISH assay confirmed monosomy/trisomy ratios however failed to show significant relationship with maternal age and embryo morphology, thereby raising questions about the reliability of the technique. Finally comparison of various parameters and nuclear organization revealed consistent alterations of the position of specific centromeres (e.g. for chromosomes 3 and 4). In conclusion, FISH is now clearly old technology for PGS but has great potential for the analysis of mosaicism and nuclear organisation.	 Thesis or dissertation	616.6921	595301	0

 An exploration of the trauma histories, dissociative experiences and psychopathic features of murderers	 Newberry, Michelle T.	 Brunel University	 Brunel University London	2008	Background: Differential relationships of the dimensions of psychopathy with external factors indicate that psychopathy can be conceptualised as a multifaceted syndrome comprised of distinct subgroups of psychopaths (Blackburn, 1988). However, it is not known whether similar subtypes of psychopathy exist across cultures. The research question which this thesis sought to answer was: Do subtypes of psychopathy exist among murderers, and if so, might the prevalence of these subtypes differ across cultures? Three aims were addressed: i) to compare the trauma histories, dissociative experiences and psychopathic features of British and South African men convicted of murder and the associations among them; ii) to test potential aetiological models of psychopathy; and iii) to explore whether subtypes of psychopathy could be identified among men convicted of murder. Method: Participants were 120 adult male prisoners serving sentences for murder. Sixty participants were British and incarcerated in prisons in England and 60 participants were South African and incarcerated in South Africa. Trauma, dissociation and psychopathy were measured using the Trauma History Questionnaire (THQ; Green, 1996), the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES; Carlson	 Thesis or dissertation	 Trauma ; Dissociation ; Dissociative experiences ; Psychopathic features	555666	0
 An exploration of the current working relationship between the educational psychologist and the young offender in England	 Hall, Sasha	 University of East London	 University of East London	2013	The purpose of this study was to explore the current working relationship between the Educational Psychologist and the Young Offender in England. It aimed to identify the work EPs have done with YOs in the previous year and to explore the Educational Psychologist’s perceptions of the characteristics they perceive as necessary for a successful relationship with a young offender. A mixed methods approach was applied whereby both quantitative and qualitative data was collected. Online questionnaires were sent to all Principal Educational Psychologists in England with the intention of the questionnaire being passed on to all Educational Psychologists within their local education authority. 47 Educational Psychologists took part in the quantitative stage, with 21 participants that were able to complete the questionnaire having worked with young offenders in the previous year. The qualitative data was collected through interviews from a sample of 8 participants. The findings suggest that the majority of Educational Psychologists’ work is commissioned by schools and Youth Offending Teams requesting support for young offenders with social, emotional and behavioural difficulties, to increase engagement, attendance, to assess their levels of need and to decrease reoffending. The participants reported that the most commonly used approach was that of solution focused. Looking at the characteristics that are necessary for a successful relationship between the Educational Psychologist and the young offender, using thematic analysis, 4 overarching themes emerged specific to the young offender and 9 specific to the Educational Psychologist. In conclusion this study achieved both its aims of conducting a survey to explore what a number of educational psychologists have done with young offenders over the previous year and to identify characteristics that the Educational Psychologists perceived to be necessary for a successful relationship with a young offender.

 Broad-band microwave amplifier design considerations	 Temple, Gordon John	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	1985	Broad-band microwave integrated circuit (MIC) amplifier design is a complex, multi-disciplinary process. This work focuses on three important aspects: the behaviour of microstrip transmission lines, discontinuities, and related structures; the accurate measurement of components and devices mounted in microstrip circuits; and the circuit design methodology. Techniques for microstrip quasi-static analysis are reviewed in order to identify methods suitable for extension to deal with the effects of substrate anisotropy. An integral equation method is described and the anisotropic Green's function derived using an extension to the method of partial images. Proposed transform methods are assessed and the preferred option implemented by adaption of a microstrip analysis computer program. A method, by which accurate measurements of microstrip properties may be made, is developed. Involving measurements of the resonant behaviour of half-wavelength short circuit resonators with two arbitrary coupling conditions, this technique allows the unloaded properties to be deduced. Results for microstrip on a sapphire substrate concur with the analysis. A pragmatic but effective approach to the calculation of the capacity component of microstrip discontinuities, and some other three dimensional MIC structures, is described and developed to allow existing data for isotropic substrates to be applied to the anisotropic situation. The computer corrected network analyser (CCNA) is a widely used microwave measurement tool. Weaknesses in popular correction strategies are identified and remedies developed. In particular, revised calibration equations that better accommodate test port mismatch variation with s-parameter selection, and a model for quadrature error are presented. A 2-port calibration scheme suitable for use with MIC transmission lines, using only simple standards, is described. The standards are partially self-calibrating;the values of propagation constant, loss, and end effect are deduced in the calibration process. An effective jig for use with microstrip is described and the results of measurements on microwave transistors presented. Conventionally microwave amplifiers are designed using reactive components both to achieve good port matches and compensate the frequency dependent gain of the active devices. The problems associated with this approach are enumerated and the alternatives reviewed. A methodology which combines the benefits of frequency dependant dissipative networks with the elegance of reactive network synthesis is described. The device gain slope is compensated by simple lumped or distributed circuits incorporating a resistive element to produce a composite `device' with a specififed (flat) maximum available gain frequency response. Reactive matching networks are then used to interface these gain blocks. By this structured approach the amplifier gain breakdown can be defined at the outset and preserved through the design process. Other advantages stemming from the use of dissipative compensation include improved tolerance to device parameter and component value scatter, reduced group delay variations and enhanced reverse isolation. The method is demonstrated by the design and characterisation of 4 to 9 GHz amplifier having a representative specification. The close conformance of the performance of the untrimmed amplifier to that predicted by computer simulation testifies to the inherent accuracy of the design method, the microstrip (and related structures) analysis techniques and the CCNA MIC calibration scheme.

 Multi-wavelength studies of wind driving cataclysmic variables	 Witherick, Dugan Kenneth	 University College London (University of London)	 UCL (University College London)	2005	This thesis presents several case studies of disc winds from high-state cataclysmic variable stars, based on multi-wavelength time-series spectroscopy. The research presented here primarily focuses on three low-inclination, nova-like systems: RW Sextansis, V592 Cassiopeiae and BZ Camelopardalis. The aim was to derive and compare key spectral line diagnostics of the outflows, spanning a wide range of ionisation and excitation using (new) FUSE, HST, IUE and optical data. Analysis of the far-UV time-series of RW Sex reveals the wind to be highly variable but generally confined to between ~ -1000 and ~ 0 km/s for all ionisation states; no evidence of the wind at red-shifted velocities is found. This wind is modulated on the orbital period of the system and it is argued that the observed variability is due to changes in the blue-shifted absorption rather than a variable velocity emission. The Balmer profiles observed in the optical time-series of V592 Cas were found to be characterised by three components: a broad, shallow absorption trough, a narrow central emission and a blue-shifted absorption from the disc wind. The wind is also found to be modulated on the systems orbital period, although this modulation is slightly out of phase with the Balmer emission radial velocities. The wind of BZ Cam was found to behave very differently to that of RW Sex and V592 Cas. At times, it was seen (in the Balmer lines and some of the He I lines) to be extremely strong and variable but at other times is was seemingly not present; there was no evidence to suggest that it is modulated on the orbital or any other period. This study is an immense source of data on CV disc winds and importantly tries to parameterise three nova-like CVs to understand the similarities and differences between them and their winds.

 A taxonomic study of Phascum cuspidatum Scheb. ex Hedw. (Pottiaceae) and its allies	 Derrick, Lewis Norman	 University of St Andrews	 University of St Andrews	1978	The moss genus Phascum is common in the Northern Hemisphere. Its species may be frequently encountered by botanists studying the moss flora of bare earth in fallow fields and gardens. Species within this genus have been recognised by taxonomists since at least 1741. The present form of the generic name dates from 1753. Yet Phascum still appears to be poorly understood. Even with available modern treatments, in floras such as Nyholm (1960) and Lawton (1971), bryologists find it difficult to recognise taxa and seem hesitant to name species. Why are these taxa difficult to identify? Is it because they are a complex of	 Thesis or dissertation	588	558414	0
 Gap junctions and connexin expression in the mouse inner ear	 Edwards, Jill Carole	 University College London (University of London)	 University of London	2004	Gap junctions are sites of direct communication between adjacent cells where clusters of channels in the membrane of one cell contact clusters of channels in the membrane of the neighbouring cell. Six constituent proteins, known as connexins (Cx), make up each hemi-channel. The channels allow the passage of small metabolites (up to 1200 Daltons in size), ions, and second messengers between cells, coupling them both electrically and chemically. This provides a means for signalling between the cells that enables co-ordinated activity of cells in a tissue and may permit one cell to trigger a response in its neighbour. Mutations of several connexin genes have been associated with deafness and the inner ear is richly endowed with gap junctions. A review of freeze fracture replicas, obtained from various species, illustrates the unusually large size and number of gap junction plaques throughout cells of the inner ear. A comprehensive analysis of the gap junctions and connexin expression in the inner ear has been performed. Using a variety of techniques these communication channels have been observed and their constituent protein isoforms characterised. Initial screening of cochlear and vestibular tissue with rt-PCR primers established which connexin isoforms might be present; immunohistochemical follow-up with an array of antibodies enabled spatial and temporal localisation of the proteins. It has been established that Cx26 and Cx30 are the major isoforms expressed in mature inner ear whilst isofoms Cx31, Cx43, Cx45 and Cx50 play a role in development of the cochlea. Isoforms Cx26 and Cx30 appear to be co-localised within the same junctional plaques and may form heteromeric gap junctions unique to the inner ear.	 Thesis or dissertation	573.89199353	411676	0

Towards a symmetrical minority citizenship : group equality in Croatia 1990-2007	 Burrai, V.	 University College London (University of London)	 University College London (University of London)	2012	This thesis explains the process of institutional equalisation of national groups which took place in Croatia between 1990 and 2007. Two readings are prevalent in the study of minority regimes. The first, more prevalent among scholars of ethnic conflict, sees the adoption of minority rights regimes as the result of political struggles, expressed in ad hoc improvement of the status of specific national groups. This approach focuses on the agency of rebellious national groups and sometimes kin-states. The second, preferred by international organisations scholarship, sees the establishment of minority regimes after 1990 as the product of the conditionality imposed by international organisations accompanied by the diffusion of international norms of fair treatment, which results in a general systems rights for the national minorities. The thesis’ institutionalist approach reconciles both readings because it recognises that the historical context conferred agency to a number of international and domestic actors interacting with the Croatian governments. Additionally it creates space for unintended consequences of institutional reforms, placing the institutional equalisation of Croatia’s national groups among them. The evolution of the Croatian rules of inclusion of national groups is explained by three arguments. Firstly, I argue that the manipulation of the list of national minorities responded to international incentives, more than to the power or characteristics of specific national groups. Secondly, I show that incremental and unintentional changes, more than the diffusion of a norm regarding group equality, were responsible for the creation of an equal system of minority rights. Thirdly, the equalisation of national groups provided previously unrecognised national groups with unprecedented access to resources and institutions, shaping their means of participation in public life and increasing their salience at state-	 Thesis or dissertation	323.11	625882	0

 Decentralised control and stability analysis of a multi-generator based electrical power system for more electric aircraft	 Gao, Fei	 University of Nottingham	 University of Nottingham	2016	 The more electric aircraft initative results in significant challenges in the design of aircraft electrical power systems. Different power system architectures are currently being studied by the engineering community. In this thesis, a promising single DC bus-based, multiple-source multiple-load power system is investigated in terms of power management and stability. Due to its inherent modularity and ease of implementation, droop control, as a decentralised control method, has been widely used to cope with power sharing among parallel sources in the studied architecture. The thesis proposes a comparative study of different droop control approaches by focusing on steady-state power sharing performance and stability. • Different droop control methods may lead to different stability margins. Until now, the effect of different droop control schemes on system stability has not been fully investigated. The thesis presents the control scheme for current-mode and voltage-mode systems, derives the corresponding output impedance of the source subsystem and analyses the stability of the power system. Based on the developed mathematical model, comprehensive modal analysis of the power system is performed. • A generalised analytical impedance analysis is extended to a multi-source multi-load power system. To facilitate the analysis, the thesis proposes the concept of “global droop gain” as an important factor to determine the V-I bus characteristic and the stability behaviour of a parallel sources based DC system. • Considering the tradeoff between voltage regulation and power sharing accuracy in droop control, this thesis proposes an improved voltage regulation method in multi-source based DC electrical power system. Due to the absence of additional controllers or communication lines, the proposed approach can be relatively easily implemented in a small scale DC electrical power system. The proposed approach effectively improves the load sharing accuracy under high droop gain circumstances with consideration of cable impedance. Optimal droop gain settings are investigated and the selection of individual droop gains has been described in order to reduce the distribution losses. Finally, the above-mentioned analytical results are confirmed by time-domain simulations and experimental results.	 Thesis or dissertation	 TK Electrical engineering.

 Linear waves on higher dimensional Schwarzschild black holes and Schwarzschild de Sitter spacetimes	 Schlue, Volker	 University of Cambridge	 University of Cambridge	2012	I study linear waves on higher dimensional Schwarzschild black holes and Schwarzschild de Sitter spacetimes. In the first part of this thesis two decay results are proven for general finite energy solutions to the linear wave equation on higher dimensional Schwarzschild black holes. I establish uniform energy decay and improved interior first order energy decay in all dimensions with rates in accordance with the 3 + 1-dimensional case. The method of proof departs from earlier work on this problem. I apply and extend the new physical space approach to decay of Dafermos and Rodnianski. An integrated local energy decay estimate for the wave equation on higher dimensional Schwarzschild black holes is proven. In the second part of this thesis the global study of solutions to the linear wave equation on expanding de Sitter and Schwarzschild de Sitter spacetimes is initiated. I show that finite energy solutions to the initial value problem are globally bounded and have a limit on the future boundary that can be viewed as a function on the standard cylinder. Both problems are related to the Cauchy problem in General Relativity.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Mathematical general relativity ; Wave equations on black hole spacetimes	556239	0

 The enactment of power within strategic interactions : a Saudi Arabian case study	 Shoaib, Haneen Mohammed	 University of Exeter	 University of Exeter	2012	 This thesis contributes to the field of strategy-as-practice by developing understanding of the enacted performance of power within strategic interactions, an area that is underdeveloped. This is addressed by voicing the silences within the field of strategy-as-practice using an organisational studies lens. The study investigates the macro-influences of power, gender, body, culture, and Westernisation on micro-strategising activities and is based on an empirical cross-cultural study of a Saudi Arabian business college. The strategy-as-practice approach faces the challenge of balancing a focus on the specified actions of individuals and remaining aware of the social influences that govern them. This study complements linguistic approaches to understanding strategy with an embodied socially enacted dramaturgical approach to strategy analysis. Dramaturgy is the theoretical and methodological framework used to focus on micro-face-to-face interactions of strategists, complemented by frame analysis which enables invistigation of macro-level aspects of analysis at the meso-organisational level. The analysis focuses on two main areas: first it explores the embodied gendered aspects of strategising, which have previously been marginalised within the field. This analysis shows how the doing and undoing of gender on a managerial level in mixed-gender strategic interactions reflects the values that govern the family context, maintaining traditional values and often constraining women from assuming active roles as participants in strategising. Second, it analyses the tensions that arise between the clash of modernity and tradition by the adoption of international/Western management practices. These institutional influences create conflicts within strategists’ scripts when tradition encounters modernity in confronting a significant aspect of the Arab struggle. This analysis focuses on the importance of adopting a multi-level of analysis that aknowledges both structure and agency within strategising contexts. It also considers the importance of adopting a different type of ethics that is more sensitive to the particularities of caring for the ‘other’.

 Atmospheric dispersion modelling of particulate and gaseous pollutants affecting the trans-Manche region	 Plainiotis, Stylianos	 University of Greenwich	 University of Greenwich	2006	This thesis describes the development of a methodology to determine large-scale and meso-scale atmospheric dispersion patterns. The research is only concerned with outdoor exposure to atmospheric pollutants and aims to identify pollution sources using dispersion modelling with the assistance of ground level measurements from British, French and other monitoring stations and remote sensing technology. Lagrangian Particle Dispersion (LPD) models compute trajectories of a large number of notional particles and can be used to numerically simulate the dispersion of a pollutant (passive tracer) in the planetary boundary layer. Two widely used atmospheric dispersion models were employed: the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model by R. Draxler, and the model FLEXPART by Stohl et al. Both models possess forward tracking and inverse (or receptor-based) modes. Meteorological data output from the PSU/NCAR Mesoscale model (known as MM5), or datasets from the European Centre of Medium-range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) are used to drive the dispersion models. Linkage routines were developed to interpret the LPD codes with the required meteorological information. This study aims to determine whether current approaches and practice for atmospheric dispersion modelling are reliable, consistent and up-to-date. An intercomparison of the models FLEXPART and HYSPLIT is performed for known episodes to determine their accuracy, ease of use, effect of source specification and to investigate their sensitivity to input data and mesh resolution, and in particular the effect of different model formulations and assumptions followed by the models. The possibility of identifying emission sources in the near and far field is investigated, by modelling dispersion backwards in time, in particular the discrimination of multiple sources from receptor data is discussed. The effect of meteorological data resolution on the output of LPD models was evaluated and the most suitable methodology for better source definition was determined for different modelling scales, ranging from the intercontinental transport of airborne pollutants to simulating pollution episodes caused by local sources.

 The theme(s) of the Joseph story : a literary analysis	 Sellee, James Bombo	 University of Gloucestershire	 University of Gloucestershire	2003	Since the 1970s the application of narrative analysis to the Joseph Story has enriched its reading. But those who apply this method to the narrative produce significantly different results in terms of what its theme is. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the reasons for this and to articulate as objectively as possible the theme of the Joseph Story. Chapter One establishes the context of this investigation by evaluating the major narrative readings of the Joseph Story. It reveals that those who apply narrative methodologies to the story come to different conclusions about what its theme is. It notes that the different results could be due to different narrative approaches, the literary context of the narrative, and the complex nature of the text itself. We choose Humphreys, Longacre, and Turner as our dialogue partners because they represent different narrative methods of reading the Joseph Story. The reference terms `narrative criticism' and `theme' are then defined. Chapter Two argues that the way to overcome the confusion concerning the theme (s) of the Joseph Story is to use a methodology that addresses the limitations of the literary approaches applied to the narrative and takes note of the wider literary context of Genesis and the rich nature of the text. This chapter then proposes a narrative methodology of `triangulation' that comprises plot analysis, text-linguistics and poetics. Chapters three, four and five apply this methodology to the entire narrative in Genesis 37-50 via a detailed analysis of Genesis 37,44-45, and 49-50, the beginning, middle and end of the narrative, respectively. The motifs that emerge from our analysis are family breakdown, power, providence, blessing, and land. Chapter six concludes that each of these motifs is a key concern of the Joseph Story but none by itself adequately articulates the story's theme. It is the ecology of these motifs that enunciates the theme: God's providential work with and through Jacob's dysfunctional family, preserving it and blessing others.

 Crystals of relative displays and Grothendieck-Messing deformation theory	 Gregory, Oliver	 University of Exeter	 University of Exeter	2016	 Displays can be thought of as relative versions of Fontaine's notion of strongly divisible lattice from integral p-adic Hodge theory. In favourable circumstances, the crystalline cohomology of a smooth projective R-scheme X is endowed with a display-structure coming from complexes associated with the relative de Rham-Witt complex of Langer-Zink, and can be thought of as a kind of mixed characteristic Hodge structure. In this thesis, we show that under certain geometric conditions, deforming X over PD-thickenings of R gives a crystal of relative displays. We then apply the crystal of relative displays to prove Grothendieck-Messing type results for the deformation theory of Calabi-Yau threefolds. We also show that primitive crystalline cohomology often carries a display-structure, and we prove a Grothendieck-Messing type result for the deformation theory of smooth cubic fourfolds in terms of the crystal of relative displays on primitive crystalline cohomology. Finally, we investigate the deformation theory of ordinary smooth cubic fourfolds in terms of the displays on the cohomology of their Fano schemes of lines.

 Dynamic methods of stiffness identification in impacting systems for rotary-percussive drilling applications	 Maolin, Liao	 University of Aberdeen	 University of Aberdeen	2016	 Stiffness identification of an impacted constraint is the main issue discussed in this thesis. Primarily, a change of stability (bifurcation) is used to determine the dynamical stiffness of an impacted beam for a piecewise-linear impact oscillator. Detailed one- and two-parameter bifurcation analyses of this impacting system are carried out by means of experiments and numerical methods. Particularly, the two-parameter numerical continuation of the obtained codimension-one bifurcation (period-doubling bifurcation, or fold bifurcation) indicates a strong monotonic correlation between the stiffness of the impacted beam and the frequency at which this bifurcation appears. In addition to the bifurcation techniques, another method for stiffness identification is analysis of impact duration. To accurately detect impact durations from numerical or experimental signals, nonlinear time series methods are utilised. Two impacting systems, including the piecewise-linear impact oscillator and a drillbit-rock vibro-impact system, are studied to demonstrate this proposed method. For either system, the impact duration is relatively constant when the response of oscillator is a period-one one-impact motion, and it is approximated as a half of the natural period of the oscillator-constraint system. When the mass of oscillator is constant, for an impacted constraint with a certain stiffness, the higher the stiffness, the lower the impact duration. This monotonic correlation provides another mechanism to estimate the stiffness of the impacted constraint. Based on the developed two dynamical methods for stiffness identification, a control algorithm for parameter adjustment of the axial vibration for rotary-percussive drilling applications is designed. This control algorithm aims to maintain the optimal drilling state under the varying formations. By this way, the efficiency of rotary-percussive drilling is expected to be promoted.

 The effect of tumour necrosis factor-alpha on airways smooth muscle contractility	 Parris, J. R. M.	 University of Aberdeen	 University of Aberdeen	1999	 A major characteristic of asthma is a hyper-responsiveness of the bronchial smooth muscle. This hyper-responsiveness is associated with an activation of inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils, which release the cytokine TNF-α. In vivo exposure of human airways to aerosolised TNF-α produces an increase in agonist-induced contractility of the bronchial smooth muscle. The cellular mechanisms of this TNF-induced hyper-responsiveness are not yet known. The aims of this thesis are to investigate the effects of TNF-α in intact and permeabilized guinea pig airways smooth muscle to determine the mechanism of TNF-induced airway hyper-responsiveness. Smooth muscle strips from guinea pig bronchi were attached to a sensitive force transducer to measure isometric tension. Strips incubated with human recombinant TNF-α for one hour revealed an increased contractile response to carbachol compared to control strips, although TNF itself produced no change in tension. In identical experiments carried out in guinea pig portal vein, no such potentiation of the agonist-induced contractile response was observed after TNF treatment. Strips of bronchial smooth muscle were permeabilized and the intracellular stores disrupted. Permeabilized strips were incubated with TNF-α in calcium free buffer (pCa 	 Thesis or dissertation	615.1	593267	0
An investigation of the role of the Epstein-Barr virus-encoded protein, EBNA1, in the regulation of EBER expression	 Owen, Thomas John	 University of Birmingham	 University of Birmingham	2010	The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded RNAs (EBERs) are abundantly expressed in all EBV-associated malignancies, although the precise mechanisms by which EBV is able to achieve such high levels of EBER expression have not been fully determined. Abundant EBER expression has previously been demonstrated to be important for the oncogenic potential of the EBERs to be realised in epithelial cells. This study aimed to elucidate further how EBV achieves abundant EBER expression. Firstly, experimental analysis focussed on the possible direct correlation between EBV genomic copy number and levels of EBER expression. These initial experiments revealed that no direct link between EBV genomic copy number and levels of EBER expression was evident, suggesting that EBV may be influencing the cellular environment. Previously, EBV has been demonstrated to induce a variety of cellular EBER-associated transcription factors, and the remainder of the study focussed on determining the role of EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) in inducing changes to the cellular environment to allow high levels of EBER expression. EBNA1 was found to induce the transcription of cellular RNA polymerase (pol) II and pol III transcription factors associated with EBER expression and levels of the cellular transcripts transcribed by the EBER-transcribing pol III were increased. Cell systems were generated which allowed EBNA1 to be expressed transiently in EBER-expressing cells, with such expression resulting in increased EBER expression, demonstrating directly that EBNA1 is able to increase levels of EBER expression. EBNA1 promoter binding studies were conducted, revealing EBNA1 to be present at the promoter regions of transcriptionally induced genes, affording mechanistic insight into EBNA1’s mode of action. The results of this study prove significant not only in determining how EBV expresses such high levels of EBERs, but also in that EBNA1 is shown to influence several cellular factors directly implicated in oncogenesis.

 Learning to rank and order answers to definition questions	 Pandey, Shailesh	 University of York	 University of York	2012	 The task of ordering a set of ranked result returned by an online search engine or an offline information retrieval engine is termed as reranking. It is called reranking for the reason that the candidate answer snippets are extracted by the information retrieval systems using some strategy for scoring, for example, based on occurrence of query words. We therefore assume the results to be already ranked and therefore the subsequent ranking is termed as reranking. Ranking drastically reduces the number of documents that will be processed further. Reranking usually involves deeper linguistic analysis and use of expert knowledge resources to get an even better understanding. The first task this thesis explores is regarding reranking of answers to definition questions. The answers are sentences returned by the google search engine in response to the definition questions. This step is relevant to definition questions because the questions tend to be short and therefore the information need of the user is difficult to assess. This means the final result is not a single piece of information but a ordered set of relevant sentences. In this thesis we explore two approaches to reranking that uses dependency tree statistics in a probabilistic setting. One of them is based on calculating edit distance between trees and tree statistics from the corpus and other one uses a tree kernel function and involves using the output from trained classifiers directly. The second task this thesis explores is the task of sentence ordering for definition questions. The reranking part of the definition question answering pipeline is able to identify the sentences that are relevant to a given question. However, answer to a definition question is a collection of sentences that has some coherent ordering between them. In a way this is not far away from the characteristics observed in a good summary. We believe that by moving sentences around to form a more coherent chunk we will be able to better meet the expectation of a user by improving his reading experience. We present an approach that finds an ordering for the sentences based on the knowledge extracted from observing the order of sentences in Wikipedia articles. Due to the popularity and acceptability of Wikipedia, proven by the fact that wikipedia results are ranked high by all major commercial search engines, it was chosen as the standard to be learnt from and compared against. We present a framework that uses the order of sentences extracted from Wikipedia articles to construct a single big graph of connected sentences. As a mechanism to select a node in the graph, we define a scoring function based on the relative position of candidate sentences.	 Thesis or dissertation	005.75	589155	0

The dynamics of larval and 0+ juvenile fish population in lowland rivers	 Nunn, Andrew David	 University of Hull	 University of Hull	2005	Early development represents a critical period in the life cycle of fishes, with a wide range of biotic and abiotic factors influencing eventual recruitment to the adult populations. Despite their key importance in the sustainability of fish populations, however, there is a dearth of knowledge regarding the ecology of 0+ fish communities in lowland rivers. Thus, the factors affecting 0+ fish populations were studied in three lowland river catchments, namely the River Trent, the Warwickshire Avon and the Yorkshire Ouse, representing a range of topographical and biotopical characteristics. The 0+ fish populations were sampled monthly between May 1999 and October 2004 inclusive by micromesh seine netting and point abundance sampling by electric fishing. Captured fish were used to obtain information on 0+ fish community structure, growth, spawning periodicity, and the food and feeding relationships of larval and 0+ juvenile fish. In the Trent and, particularly, the Avon, rheophilic fish species were heavily outnumbered by eurytopic species due to a lack of suitable spawning and nursery habitat for rheophilic species. Strictly rheophilic species were most abundant in the Ouse catchment where the habitat was characterised by fast-flowing water and a sand or gravel substratum. Almost all fish species used floodplain waterbodies at some point in their life history. For some species this use was transitional (rheophilic species) or facultative (eurytopic species), whereas for others it may be obligate (lirnnophilic species). Floodplain waterbodies also served as refugia for both 0+ and	 Thesis or dissertation	 Biological sciences	421992	0

 Positron annihilation on core electrons	 Green, D. G.	 Queen's University Belfast	 Queen's University Belfast	2012	Diagrammatic many-body theory (MBT) is used to calculate the -y-spectra and an- nihilation rates for positrons annihilating on the core electrons of many-electron atoms. Long-range positron-atom and short-range positron-electron correlations are accounted for through the evaluation of the positron Dyson orbital and the true many-body annihilation vertex, which includes the exact electron-positron ladder series. The numerical implementation of the theory proceeds through the employment of a B-spline basis. It is tested through a comprehensive study of positron annihilation in the hydrogen-like ions He ", Li2+, BH and F8+, the ionization energies of which span those typical of the core electrons of many-electron atoms. The scattering phase shifts and normalized annihilation rate parameters Zeff are found to be in excellent agreement with existing sophisticated variational calculations, and -y-spectra are also predicted. , The annihilation ')'-spectra and partial annihilation rates are then calculated for ther- malized positrons annihilating on the core and valence electrons of the noble gas atoms Ar, Kr and Xe. Although stronger for the valence shells, the short-range correlations are found to significantly enhance the -y-spectra of the core subshells. For Ar, Kr and Xe, the core contributions to Zeff are found to be 0,55%, 1.5% and 2.2% respectively, their small values reflecting the difficulty for the positron to probe distances close to the nucleus. However, the core subshells have a broad momentum distribution and they markedly contribute to, and even dominate, the -y-spectra at Doppler energy shifts .2::. 3 ke V. It is found that proper inclusion of the core spectra is crucial in bringing the theoretical spectra into agreement with the experiment across the full range of Doppler energy shifts. State-dependent vertex enhancement factors 1nl, which quantify the effects of the short- range correlations, are estimated analytically and calculated using the MBT. They are found to follow a simple and physically motivated scaling with the subshell ionization energy Inz: 1nl = 1 + AI.;r;:z + sr], where A, Band (3 are positive constants.

It has been shown that when Fe2C 3 is present at the surface CO2 and H2 are observed from surface formates, while neighbouring pairs of molybdena sites leads to the production of formaldehyde and water from surface methoxys. When molybdenum sites are isolated then the surface methoxy is stabilised and a direct pathway to CO and H2 is created. On molybdena rich surfaces the production of CO is observed, but as a secondary oxidation product following the linear pathway: CH3OH	 Thesis or dissertation	543	584243	0
French poetry in England 1880-1930 : translation and mediation	 Higgins, J. A.	 University of Cambridge	 University of Cambridge	2008	My thesis explores the influence of French poetry in England during those years, taking translations into English as its focus. This provides the basis for examination of ideas, attitudes and even forms and structures that were ‘transferred’ from France into English poetry by translators from varied literary backgrounds. Alongside the exigencies of publishers and editors, the aims and ambitions of the translators influenced their choice of texts and modes of translation. Changing perceptions of the literature and culture of France influenced the choices of translators (or commissioning publishers) wishing to express an affinity with, or to appropriate aspects of the reputation of, the source text and culture. Cultural emulation becomes particularly significant in the case of, for example, the translator-poets of the 1890s, whose fascination with French poetry of the late nineteenth century was inextricably linked to their perceptions of Parisian literary café culture and its ‘decadent’ associations. The thesis has at its core close readings of translations alongside their source texts. It will also draw upon aspects of translation theory and cultural studies for its exploration of motivation, influence and hierarchy surrounding the translation process. Small literary magazines are a fundamental source material, for the translations they contain, but also the context in which they place these translations. Some appear in magazines in which the same author contributes criticism or other commentaries: these juxtapositions can reveal much about the inspiration for the translations. However, the research is not limited to translations published in magazines, nor to well-known writers or translators: It also takes into account translations by non-professional translators.

 A model study of decadal climate variability and predictability associated with the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation	 Persechino, Aurelie S. A.	 University of Southampton	 University of Southampton	2012	This study addresses the decadal variability and predictability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), and associated key variables, in two IPCC-class climate models. The AMOC variability is analyzed in a new climate model CHIME, which features a novel (largely isopycnic) ocean component. Power Spectral analysis reveals enhanced variability for periods in the range 15-30 years. The primary mode of variability is associated with decadal changes in the Labrador and the Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian (GIN) seas, in both cases linked to the tropical activity about 15 years earlier. These decadal changes are controlled by the low-frequency North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), associated with a tropical-extratropical teleconnection. Poleward advection of salinity anomalies in the mixed layer also leads to AMOC changes that are linked to convective processes in the Labrador Sea. A secondary mode of variability is associated with interannual changes in the Labrador and GIN Seas, through the impact of the NAO on local surface density. The decadal potential predictability of the AMOC and climate as represented in the non-isopycnic IPSL-CM5A model and CHIME is explored using prognostic and diagnostic approaches. The modelled AMOC has an average predictive skill of 8 and 6 years, respectively. Over the ocean, surface temperature has the highest skill up to 2 decades in the far north of the North Atlantic, in both models. Additional oceanic areas of predictability are identified in IPSL-CM5A in the tropics and subtropics. The spatio-temporal predictability of both surface temperature over land and precipitation differs somewhat between the two models, but is of limited extent compared to that of ocean variables. Predictability of climate arises from the mechanisms controlling the decadal AMOC fluctuations. Predictive skills of AMOC and climate are favoured by extreme AMOC events but the role of minimum versus maximum states remains to be clarified. The expected better predictive skills of CHIME over non-isopycnic models (due to its better preservation of water masses and more coherent internal structure to the anomalies) are not borne out.

The writing on the wall : (accessing) children's meanings of land in the Outer Hebrides at the beginning of the 21st century	 Thomson, Fionagh	 UCL Institute of Education (IOE)	 Institute of Education, University of London	2008	In 1990 the United Nations Convention of the rights of the child recognised children as a minority group, social actors with a right to be heard. In parallel, interest in children's voices increased within academia. TIlls research adds to current work witllin children's geograpllles, through an exploratory case study in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland, with a group of children (6 to 12 years old). Based on a series of workshops, participants were invited to become artists-inresidence on the theme of land within their everyday lives. Tllls thesis set two substantive questions: what are participants' meanings of land in the Outer Hebrides and how do these meanings relate to current theories around human's relationship with land? Findings sho'.'.'eo that meanings of land were not uniform though meanings embodied movement through daily lives, creating a sense of self and 'belonging' Participams were nor controlled excessively by adult narratives of stranger-danger but by the physical topography, wlllch mirrored many inhabitants' experiences. Participant's meanings of land are understood through two theories of human's relationslllp with land. First, Ingold's phenomenological concept of landscape as dwelling, recognising the influence of past generations (walking the land tending sheep), and more 'modern' activities, (watching soap operas at home). Second, Massey's concept of progressive sense of place, recognising the influence of wider social forces and explains an everyday land inhabited by a Bengal tiger. Tllls research has a number of original contributions. First, this research increases knowledge on an under researched part of the Scottish Islands around inhabitants everyday lives and land. Second, a third, and methodological, research question explored the debate: is doing research with children different from doing research with adults? Here I argue that pre-labelling any participants by social identities contradicts the bottom-up approach of participatory methodologies (Thomson, 2007), as identities are multiple and are something we do not have. Tllls flnal issues aims to address the narrow readerslllp within children's geograpllles and persmde all researcbers to uo longer yjew the 'chjld' as 'other' to the adult and outside mainstream social research.

 A phytochemical and pharmacological investigation of Momordica charantia Linn. fruit with respect to its reputed anti-diabetic properties	 Lau, Clara Bik-San	 King's College London (University of London)	 University of London	1998	Plants have been used traditionally for the treatment of diabetes mellitus all over the world. One such example is the bitter-tasting unripe fruit of Momordica charantia Linn. (Cucurbitaceae), commonly known as karela. Numerous studies in humans, animals and in vitro models have demonstrated a potential beneficial effect of karela juice or extracts in diabetes. However, the mode of action and active components of karela have not been satisfactorily explained. The present study aimed to use a systematic, relevant approach (bioassay-guided fractionation) to isolate and identify orally active anti-diabetic phytochemicals in karela, and to elucidate its mode of action. Our results showed that karela from different geographical origins varied in both their physical appearance and chemical constituents. Two varieties (Thai and Kenyan) of karela juice exhibited anti-hyperglycaemic (significant improvement in oral glucose tolerance) but not hypoglycaemic (no effect on basal glycaemia) activities in streptozotocin-induced non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDD) rats. Thai karela, being more potent, was studied further. We observed for the first time in vivo insulin secretagogue activity by karela juice. The water extract of karela juice significantly improved oral glucose tolerance but not intraperitoneal or intravenous glucose tolerance, implying that it inhibits glucose absorption from the gut or influences glucose sensitive gut hormones. The hexane extract improved oral and intraperitgneal but not intravenous glucose tolerance suggesting that it may possess a hepatic insulin sensitising effect, possibly in addition to an effect on the gut. This extract also inhibited in vitro intestinal glucose absorption in a brush border membrane vesicle model. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the hexane extract led to the isolation and identification of 3 compounds: 5,25-stigmastadien-3-ol (approx. 0.15%w/w yield), momordicine I (0.05%w/w) and ß-sitosterol. Both 5,25-stigmastadienol and ßsitosterol were shown to improve oral glucose tolerance at doses of 4.6mg/kg and 3.1mg/kg respectively in NIDD rats. Momordicine I was not tested. We concluded that karela is most likely to contain more than a single anti-diabetic component and it exhibits its anti-hyperglycaemic activity via a combination of modes of action	 Thesis or dissertation	615.32363	478909	0

 The relationships between human pineal function and thermoregulation at rest and during exercise	 Marrin, Kelly	 Liverpool John Moores University	 Liverpool John Moores University	2012	The pineal gland and its secretory product, melatonin, have a fundamental role in the control of human circadian rhythms. Most studies have investigated circadian variation in Pineal function at rest, and an inverse relationship between melatonin and core temperature rhythms has been reported. Nevertheless, there is a lack of research on these relationships during exercise. Such research is important for ascertaining how much exercise 'masks' endogenous secretion of melatonin as well as for explaining how exercise itself influences the circadian system in humans. The studies in this thesis are designed to help fill this dearth of knowledge in exploring relationships between circadian variation in melatonin 'and core body temperature at- rest and during exercise Because most past studies have involved small sample sizes, meta-analytical methods were employed in study 1 to determine the precise effects of exogenous melatonin on core body temperature and explore the impact of various moderating variables on this temperature change. Following an extensive literature search, 33 studies involving a total of 193 participants and 429 separate melatonin ingestions were meta-analysed. The weighted mean (95% CI) reduction in body temperature was found to be 0.21 (0.18-0.24) DC. Gender and time of day of melatonin ingestion had negligible effects on this reduction (P	 Thesis or dissertation	612,492	570700	0

 The effectiveness of incentive payment systems : an empirical test of individualism as a boundary condition	 Clark, David Gregory	 London School of Economics and Political Science (University of London)	 London School of Economics and Political Science	1992	Incentive payment systems became more widely used by companies in the 1980s; their acceptance was supported by the predictions of theorists in disciplines such as economics and social psychology. These theoretical traditions have for the most part proceeded separately, but we argue, there is potential for combining these insights of different traditions to improve the predictive power of models of incentive pay. To this end, this study demonstrates the potential of an interdisciplinary approach to modelling incentive pay. Closer inspection of current models finds that they are founded on assumptions of rational economic man, including calculative individualism. In practice, however, these assumptions often do not hold. We hypothesize that explicitly specifying individualistic values among employees as a boundary condition for the successful operation of incentive pay systems can improve models' predictive power. Our hypotheses are tested by reference to a data set of the opinions of 1240 employees in 14 companies across England and Wales. An incentive pay model was found to have greater predictive power among relatively individualistic employees than among those of relatively collectivistic value sets. In addition, the incidence of an incentive pay system was associated with more effort being supplied among individualistic employees, but there was no significant difference in the effort supplied by collectivistic employees whether or not they are covered by an incentive pay system.

 Nonlinear acoustics and an inverse scattering problem	 Schofield, John	 University of East Anglia	 University of East Anglia	2016	 This Ph.D. is concerned with wave propagation problems. The main focus is on nonlinear acoustics, looking at sonic boom propagation in a physically realistic atmosphere, whilst a secondary part will look at the problem of landmine detection and how to improve the target detection rates. The work on nonlinear acoustics emerged as a desire to model the behaviour of the sonic booms formed by supersonic aircraft in the atmosphere to see what environmental impact they would have on people and animals on the ground, in terms of the form of the sound waves once they reach the ground. The work on landmine detection originated from a Knowledge Transfer Partnership between the University of East Anglia (UEA) and Cobham Technical Services (CTS) organised through the Knowledge Transfer Network (KTN). This partnership took the form of a six month internship with work undertaken afterwards to publish the findings of the internship.	 Thesis or dissertation	534	687929	0
 The life-history strategies of riparian spiders (Araneae)	 Caradine, Emma L.	 University of Leicester	 University of Leicester	1998	 This thesis addresses the life-history strategies of cursorial riparian spiders using field- and laboratory-based research. Species distributions were compared to important habitat variables with particular reference to disturbance. The nature of a "habitat templet" for riparian spiders was also examined. No 'typical' riparian spider fauna was identified. Most dominant species were opportunistic aeronauts, associated with disturbed habitats. Disturbance accounted for little variation in distributions. This is attributed to all sites being disturbed, with the actual frequency of flooding having little influence. Light penetration, the proportion of sand in the substrate, amount of exposed substrate and leaf-litter depth all significantly influenced the distribution of spiders. The influence of disturbance on the life-history traits of two congeneric and co-habiting lycosids (Paradosa argicola and P. amentata) was examined using manipulated levels of flooding. This showed that both species have evolved different strategies to cope with the consequences of flooding. P. amentata, a widespread generalist, had more plastic development periods and instar sizes across different treatments. Traits of P. agricola, a habitat specialist, were not plastic and this species has evolved a greater tolerance to flooding. Examination of the reproductive strategies of P. agricola and P. amentata revealed that both species can adjust their reproductive output. Both species produced smaller clutches later in the season. Offspring of these clutches had larger instars and shorter development periods, which is assumed to increase juvenile survival in conditions of greater environmental stress. No trade-off existed between the numbers and sizes of eggs within clutches. Maternal body size, however, was positively associated with clutch size and weight. Maternal size had no influence on egg sizes.	 Thesis or dissertation	 dc_subject:: @@MISSING-DATA	696434	0

Interactive whole class teaching in science lessons in Key Stage 2 classes	 McMahon, Kendra Jill	 Bath Spa University	 Bath Spa University	2010	This study aims to contribute to the development of models of teaching science at Key Stage 2 (pupils aged 7-11 years) by considering the role of 'interactive whole class teaching', a teaching strategy advocated by the UK government's primary literacy and numeracy strategies in the late 1990s. An exploration of the meaning of 'interactive whole class teaching' brings a sociocultural perspective on the role of talk to the predominantly social constructivist models of teaching science in primary schools. Two case studies of primary teachers' practice have been constructed, each consisting of a sequence of lessons that make up an entire science topic, providing a rich, situated account of the role of interactive whole class teaching in science lessons over an extended time. A key method of enquiry has been the analysis of video data and respondent validation through video stimulated reflective dialogues. The meanings of dialogic and authoritative episodes of whole class teaching are considered in terms of the development of conceptual and procedural scientific knowledge on the social plane of the class over episodes, lessons and sequences of lessons. The findings indicate that whole class teaching has a role in the ongoing elicitation and discussion of children's ideas about concepts and procedures, creating and maintaining an intermental development zone for the class. It also has a role in modelling scientific procedures, and in exploring the relationship between phenomena, experiment and explanations to construct a version of science. Recommendations are made as to how the existing models of teaching science could make the relationships between the nature of whole class interactions, type of teaching activities and pedagogical aims more explicit. The case studies raise questions about determining an appropriate balance between dialogic and authoritative talk in primary science to develop a discourse that values both existing scientific knowledge and children's appropriation and transformation of this knowledge through negotiation within the social plane of the primary classroom.

 Searches for supersymmetric partners of third generation quarks and measurement of the tt ̄+Z process using the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider	 McFayden, Joshua A.	 University of Sheffield	 University of Sheffield	2013	This thesis presents results using data collected by the ATLAS experiment during 2011 and 2012 at √s = 7 TeV and 8 TeV respectively. The focus of the work presented in this thesis is separated into two areas, measurement of the tt ̄+Z process and searches for the supersymmetric partners to third generation quarks. Firstly, a search for tt ̄+ Z production using 4.7 fb−1 of √s = 7 TeV data is described including the generation of the dedicated simulated signal Monte Carlo samples for the analysis. The result is interpreted in terms of a 95% probability upper limit on the tt ̄+ Z production cross section of 0.71 pb. This is compatible with NLO Standard Model prediction of 0.14 pb. Secondly, a number of searches for the supersymmetric partners of bottom (sbottom) and top (stop) quarks are described. The first is a search for sbottom squark pair production in the b_1 → b_1 χ^0_1 decay channel using 2.05 fb−1 of √s = 7 TeV ATLAS data. No significant excess is observed above the Standard Model expectation and exclusion limits at the 95% confidence level are set in the m_b_1 − m_χ^0_1 plane. For a massless neutralino sbottom masses are excluded up to 390 GeV. For neutralino mass of 120 GeV sbottom masses are excluded for 275	 Thesis or dissertation	500	595068	0

 'A different kind of truth' : fictionality in the novels of John Irving	 Johnson, Lucas Stacey	 University of Birmingham	 University of Birmingham	2001	 Critical responses to John Irving's fiction have generally adhered to the well-rehearsed notion that there is an unbridgeable divide between certain literary forms and traditions. The oppositional thinking that has tended to dominate twentieth-century literary criticism has consequently produced a distorted and rigidly binaristic view of Irving, as either realist or postmodemist, populist or experimentalist. This thesis sets out to establish a more complex language or framework for discussing Irving's work, which, rather than erasing or ignoring those features that appear anomalous when placed within the narrow parameters of a single literary tradition, is more able to accommodate and analyze the tensions and contradictions that arise through the juxtaposition and interaction of multiple literary codes. In particular, this approach is designed to facilitate a more complex and fluid exploration of the deployment of metafictional strategies in Irving's novels, as I argue that his work demonstrates the acute interest in the issue of fictionality that is characteristic of metafictional writing, without either rupturing the reader/writer contract or rejecting the referential function of literary fiction. Irving's work thus both explores and reasserts the capacity of narrative fiction to convey different kinds of truth.	 Thesis or dissertation	813.54	396457	0
 Health and ill-health in a coalmining community in West Fife	 Jones, Ian George	 University of Edinburgh	 University of Edinburgh	1979	A working model of the WHO definition of health was developed which involved dialogue with health workers and members of the community. The method developed was applied to the investigation of the health and health care of a mining community in West Fife. In general, health care facilities were found to be less than adequate to cope with presend demand and co-operation between certain services was poor. A cohort of 427 men who had all worked at one coalmine in West Fife in 1955 was traced in 1977. By combining information from standard NHS sources with that supplied by survivors still living in Fife, it was possible to ascertain the vital status of all the cohort, and to confirm this in 97%. Cohort mortality was investigated using actuarial methods and in general did not differ from that of other men in Britain of the same age. Some differences were found in cause-specific mortality and difficulties in interpreting these data are discussed. A stratified simple random sample of men still resident in West Fife was investigated by interview and, where appropriate, by examination of their hospital records and discussion with their GPs. The response rate to the questionnaire was 100%. The men were found to have high levels of ill-health. Difficulties they encountered with the local health services are discussed. All teenage recruits into the cohort in the early 1950s who were still living in Fife were similarly interviewed and the replies supplemented by information from GPs and hospital records. The response rate to the questionnaires was 100%. All these men had been face-workers at some time although less than half were still employed in the coalmining industry at the time of interview. The men were found to have very high levels of acute and chronic ill-health and 14% were confirmed to have severe disability as a direct consequence of their work in the mines. The prevalence of ill-health was much higher than among other men in Scotland and this difference could not be explained on the basis of selective migration of healthy men away from the area.

 'Let me draw your attention to sleep'	 Marchetti, Lauren MacPhee	 University of Glasgow	 University of Glasgow	2006	Psychophysiologic insomnia (PI) is a disorder of somatized tension and learned sleep-preventing associations (ICSD-R). Numerous authors contend that PI is the result of numerous psychological factors. Accumulated evidence supports the notion that PI are preoccupied with sleep, and the impact of not sleeping, and that this drives various behaviours, e.g. selective attention (SA) and monitoring, that result in worrisome thoughts and excessive anxiousness. SA, more commonly termed Attention Bias (AB), can be measured objectively using computerised cognitive probe tasks where information processing speed is taken as a proxy for biases in attention. These tasks use salient and neutral word or picture stimuli within an experimental test paradigm, and most identified AB effects have been attributed to perceived threat. Direct assessment of AB in PI is limited. At the outset of this PhD, namely Experiment 1 and 2, novel AB paradigms were used to confirm the existence of AB in PI to sleep related stimuli. Indeed, AB effects in PI do not appear to be an idiosyncratic finding. Experiment 3 attempts to underpin the components of attention, i.e. engagement or disengagement processes, which are responsible for the AB data of PI, through the use of a Modified Posner Paradigm. The data suggest that delayed disengagement away from salient stimuli are responsible for the AB effects captured. Finally, Experiment 4 differentiates the experimental stimuli in terms of emotional salience, i.e. positive or negative, to assess whether all stimulus valences generate the AB effect in PI. Here the data suggest that negative sleep-related stimuli are most salient to PI in capturing attention.	 Thesis or dissertation	 BF Psychology	443444	0

 The perspectives of health professionals on the psychosocial impact of an altered appearance among adolescents treated for cancer	 Williamson, Heidi-Marie	 University of the West of England, Bristol	 University of the West of England, Bristol	2012	Despite evidence suggesting that an altered appearance can impact on the psychological and social functioning of adolescent cancer patients, patient and parental reports imply that the provision of appearance-related psychosocial support can be inadequate. This study therefore investigated the perspectives of 62 health professionals from paediatric oncology multi-disciplinary teams across the UK, regarding the impact of appearance change on adolescent patients, their experiences of delivering appearance-related care, and their training needs in this area. A two-phase qualitatively driven mixed methods design was employed. An inductive qualitative approach was used in phase one to generate detailed data about a thus far unexplored topic. Findings from this phase informed phase two: a deductive mixed qualitative / quantitative approach employed to triangulate and further explore the initial qualitative themes. The findings from both parts were then integrated to incorporate the depth of part one with the breadth of part two. Integrated findings were divided into two main outcomes. The first depicts health professionals' perceptions of the psychosocial and behavioural impact of appearance distress and their experiences of interventions that prevent or ameliorate appearance concern. The second illustrates personal barriers (among health professionals, adolescents and parents) and organisational barriers that can combine to inhibit the delivery of appearance-related support and suggestions by health professionals on how these may be overcome. Findings demonstrate that the appearance needs of patients are extensive and varied, but due to the barriers identified can be poorly addressed or overlooked. Nonetheless some practitioners are utilising a variety of interventions supported by theory and evidence of their success in other clinical areas. Recommendations are made for the content, design and co-ordination of appearance interventions for adolescents and for the content of education programmes to meet the training needs identified by participants.

The changing face of the local government of education in the 21st century : living with the private sector in selected local authorities as seen by their chief officers and others	 Nicholson, Elizabeth A. J.	 University of Birmingham	 University of Birmingham	2010	The implementation of the Education Reform Act (DES 1988) saw fundamental changes in the structure of education in England; in the relationship between schools and local education authorities and in the establishment of the private sector as a competitor to local education authorities in delivering services. Further legislation introduced by both the then Conservative Government and after 1997 by a Labour Government saw these changes further embedded. This research seeks through a review of literature to find out why those legislative changes were implemented and by investigating four local education authorities review how those changes impacted on their performance. This is a qualitative study that gathered data through the use of semi-structured interviews to create four case studies. Against a background of successive governments seeing the use of the market place, competition and the private sector as a means of delivering their aim of improving public sector performance this research provides an insight into how four local authorities worked with the private sector following their Ofsted inspections.

 Regulation of extrafollicular immunoglobulin class switch recombination	 George, Laura	 University of Birmingham	 University of Birmingham	2014	The humoral immune response is characterised by the production of antibody secreting B cells. Some of these cells have cycled through the germinal centre, diversifying and optimising their antigen receptors to produce affinity-matured, class switched antibody. As this is a relatively slow process, the first class switched antibody is produced by non-mutated B blasts that have differentiated independently of the germinal centre reaction outside B-cell follicles. Extrafollicular foci of plasmablasts provide the first line of defence within the adaptive antibody response. IRF4 has been shown to be essential for Ig class switching and plasma-cell differentiation. Two expression levels of IRF4 were reported, with intermediate levels proposed to regulate CSR in the GC, while high levels regulate plasma-cell differentiation. We have correlated the two phases of IRF4 induction with specific stages of B-cell differentiation. Following immunisation of quasi-monoclonal mice with NP-Ficoll, intermediate levels of IRF4 protein are expressed by all B blasts as they move to the outer T zone and before the formation of germinal centres or plasma cells. This is followed by expression of AID and CSR. In contrast, plasma-cell differentiation occurs with high level expression of IRF4, expression of Blimp1 and complete suppression of AID and CSR. The NFκB family signalling molecules C-REL and NFκB1 have been shown to be required for the induction of IRF4 protein in B cells following stimulation. We show that these signalling molecules are not necessary to induce the early rapid intermediate level expression of IRF4, and extrafollicular expression of AID and CSR occur normally when they are absent. IRF4-high expression and plasma-cell differentiation, however, are blocked in the absence of these molecules.	 Thesis or dissertation	QR180 Immunology	607250	0
 Current views of the characteristics of school effectiveness in the context of national secondary schools from the perceptions of principals, heads of department and teachers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia	 Iyer, Mohan Gopala	 University of Leicester	 University of Leicester	2008	The introduction of the National Philosophy of Education in 2000 in Malaysia resulted in rapid developments in education that called for fresh school effectiveness Research. This research will synthesize current and key characteristics of school effectiveness as well as a current definition of an effective school. The pilot sample consisted of principals from private secondary schools in Kuala Lumpur. The research sample consisted of 120 respondents consisting principals, heads of department and teachers from 40 national secondary schools in Kuala Lumpur. The selection was by random stratified sampling with pre-set criteria. The response rate was 84%. The instrument used was a questionnaire triangulated by interviews with respondents from two randomly selected schools and a Federal Inspectorate of Schools official. The five current characteristics selected were effective teaching and learning, principals’ leadership skills, student self-discipline, good behavior among students and greater cooperation between principal and teacher and among teachers. Five main qualities of an effective principal were also synthesized. The five key characteristics of school effectiveness selected are: A principal who is strong, purposeful and involved; effective teaching and learning; greater cooperation between principal and teacher and among teachers; greater collegiality between principal and teacher and among teachers and effective parental involvement. 22 additional characteristics of school effectiveness were suggested. The definition of an effective school synthesized in this research had one descriptor in line with the National Philosophy of Education and other descriptors in line with the selected current and key characteristics of school effectiveness. The interview with the Inspectorate official indicated that currently majority of the national secondary schools in Kuala Lumpur were effective.

 Getting a handle on children's drawings : a cognitive approach	 Sutton, Pamela Jane	 University of Plymouth	 University of Plymouth	1995	 Many researchers of children's drawings have concentrated on assessing how drawing develops through several stages. Around eight years of age the child progresses from producing drawings based on internal stereotypes of objects (intellectually realistic stage), to producing drawings which reflect an external view of these objects (visually realistic stage). This research has highlighted numerous variables which affect this developmental sequence and has shown that children as young as four can produce visually realistic drawings under certain circumstances. The present study firstly conducted a series of cross-sectional experiments to assess two of the variables highlighted by previous research, i.e. instructions and the order of presentation of tasks. Children between four and eight years of age were asked to draw various cup and ball models while these variables were manipulated. By employing the novel procedure of measuring the amount of attention that the children paid towards the drawing models, it was possible to gain insight into underlying cognitive mechanisms. The research showed that intellectual and visual realism can be artificially induced by procedural changes that affect the amount of strategic attention that the child employs in a drawing task. Increased attention is associated with visual realism while reduced attention is associated with intellectual realism. This thesis therefore concludes that there are no distinct stages of development, but instead these are a by-product of strategic attentional processes. In order to place drawing in a broader cognitive context, a longitudinal study was then conducted which assessed drawing in relation to memory and selective attention. The developmental patterns of performance, strategy use and metacognitive awareness in the drawing task, were similar to those in the memory and selective attention tasks. This suggested that children have underlying abilities common to these three different cognitive areas. It was concluded that there is a need to assess drawing within the context of general cognitive development.	 Thesis or dissertation	155	260385	0

 Wavelet bump extraction (WBE) for editing variable amplitude fatigue loadings	 Abdullah, Shahrum	 University of Sheffield	 University of Sheffield	2005	In durability testing of automobiles, load histories collected for laboratory testing are often lengthy in time. Therefore, a fatigue data editing technique is needed to summarise the load history. A fatigue mission synthesis algorithm, called Wavelet Bump Extraction (WBE) preserves the original load cycle sequences has been developed. The basis of WBE is to identify the important features or bumps that cause the majority of the fatigue damage. Bumps are identified in the frequency bands of the load spectrum using an orthogonal wavelet transform. Bumps are then extracted and combined to produce a mission signal with an equivalent fatigue damage as the onginal signal. The WBE validation was performed by analysing the cycle sequence effects in variable amplitude (VA) loadings. The experimental fatigue lives of the shortened VA loadings (Choi 2004) were compared to those predicted using strain-life fatigue damage models, i.e. Coffin-Manson, Morrow, Smith-Watson-Topper and Effective Strain Damage (ESD). The smallest difference was found between the experiment and ESD model, suggesting it is a suitable model for the use with WBE. Comparison between WBE and the time domain fatigue data editing was also conducted in order to observe its effectiveness for accelerated fatigue tests. Moreover, it is useful to evaluate the fatigue life of the original and mission signals by means of fatigue damage preservation in the mission signal. Finally, an analysis of the bump segments sequence effects was performed in order to determine an appropriate mission signal for accelerated fatigue tests. The WBE algorithm showed a substantial compression of the VA loadings could be achieved whilst maintaining fatigue damage and the important load sequences. The ability of the WBE algorithm to shorten fatigue loadings would be expected to prove useful in accelerated fatigue testing of automobiles. Finally, the combination of WBE and ESD provides a novel application of the wavelet-based fatigue data editing.	 Thesis or dissertation	629.240287	422181	0
 Students' voices in the context of integrated arts curriculum projects in three primary schools in Hong Kong	 Tsang, Ngo-Yin	 University of Exeter	 University of Exeter	2011	This thesis explores students' voices in the context of integrated arts curriculum projects in three primary schools in Hong Kong. With a postmodern orientation this study looks into students' views, experiences. performances and their interactions with the participating arts teachers in a freer space within the panoptic school buildings situated in the Hong Kong Chinese culture. The research questions for the study are: What are the primary students' views about integrated arts? How do the students create their work across the arts? How do the students interact with their teachers and peers in the Projects? What school features are created that support students' voices in this Projects" How do the students position the arts teachers and the researcher in the Projects') This study involved three Integrated Arts Projects (lA Projects) in three Hong Kong primary schools with forty-five students aged from ten to eleven in Primary 4 and 5. The students voluntarily joined these projects. which were not scheduled in their school timetable. Each lA Project was different in terms of the curricula, student groups, arts teachers, the participants' working styles and views on the arts. In each project, with a maximum of twelve sessions, each student group undertook creative work in the integrated arts on the themes and in the rooms of their own choice, and finally gave a presentation/performance in the last session. Throughout the projects, the participating arts teachers tried to make as little intervention as possible in students' creative processes. This practice was not common in regular school days. In formed by the postmodernist philosophical assumptions of this research, students' experiences and understandings in these projects were explored by the Mosaic Approach, which consists of multi pie research methods. including established methods such as observations and group discussions, and creative methods such as student-led photography, mind journals. game Web and sticky-notes. These methods help deconstruct the students' voices in the Projects into small narratives. With the use of discourse analysis, the mosaic of students' voices merged and assembled, interweaving Hong Kong Chinese culture and postmodern thought. The analysis is in three chapters: Macro, Micro and Creative Work and Processes. The Macro is about the discussions of space. time. appearances: power/know ledge: power and resistance in the projects. The Micro is about the students' views about the roles of the participating arts teachers and the researcher (myself), and their views on the relationships between the arts. The final analysis chapter links students' creative work and processes to the analyses of the Macro and the Micro. The overall findings illustrate the tension between students' voices and the I-long Kong Chinese culture. Part Five presents the integration and synthesis of this research, including the implications for theory, methodology and practice in the creative arts. This study demonstrates the potential of heterotopias in supporting students' voices in the Integrated Arts Projects in the Hong Kong Chinese context. Furthermore, this study also demonstrates the use of the adapted Mosaic Approach to explore students' voices in the primary school context of Hong Kong.	 Thesis or dissertation	372.5	573922	0
 Cellular patterns during leaf development	 Sanchez-Corrales, Yara	 University of East Anglia	 University of East Anglia	2013	 A major problem in developmental biology is to understand how the behaviour of individual cells creates reproducible biological shapes. Moreover, the reproducibility of form also happens at the cellular level and cellular patterns are evident in the temporal as well as the spatial scales. Understanding the principles underlying these cellular patterns will contribute to linking the individual cell dynamics to the collective phenomenon of morphogenesis. The relatively flat shape, the absence of cell migration and apoptosis makes the leaf of Arabidopsis thaliana an excellent system to study morphogenesis at the cellular level. However the information about the cellular dynamics that is available has only been inferred indirectly or restricted to few cells. In this thesis, I present some methods that permitted the characterisation of cellular dynamics over long time periods at the organ level. I present the Lobe Contribution Elliptical Fourier Analysis (LOCO-EFA), that enabled the quantification of complex cell geometries and provided a shape profile to evaluate populations of cells. In turn, the shape profile of individual cells was used to develop a tracking algorithm that, integrated with a segmentation algorithm, resulted in a powerful tool to recognize cells in a succession of images and extract cell shape, cell area, cell position and cell lineages. The synergy between in vivo imaging and computational tools permitted the study of cellular patterns at unprecedented resolution. Interestingly, the dynamics of cell growth and cell shape are highly influenced by the cell age and to a limited extend, by their position. Moreover, direct measurement of cell division shows that the division zone is restricted towards the base of the leaf, but is not constant in length and that the frequency of divisions decreases over time in a rather gradual fashion. At single cell level, new events of lobe formation were identified, suggesting that the intracellular patterning underlying the multi-polar pavement cell shape is dynamic and lobes are newly formed rather than being specified at a single time point. The cellular dynamics of growth, shape and divisions using long time-lapse and imaging enabled me to revisit previous hypothesis and propose new ones about the regulation of cellular behaviour during leaf morphogenesis.

 Multimodal characterisation of sensorimotor oscillations	 Rönnqvist, Kim	 Aston University	 Aston University	2013	 The studies in this project have investigated the ongoing neuronal network oscillatory activity found in the sensorimotor cortex using two modalities: magnetoencephalography (MEG) and in vitro slice recordings. The results have established that ongoing sensorimotor oscillations span the mu and beta frequency region both in vitro and in MEG recordings, with distinct frequency profiles for each recorded laminae in vitro, while MI and SI show less difference in humans. In addition, these studies show that connections between MI and SI modulate the ongoing neuronal network activity in these areas. The stimulation studies indicate that specific frequencies of stimulation affect the ongoing activity in the sensorimotor cortex. The continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) study demonstrates that cTBS predominantly enhances the power of the local ongoing activity. The stimulation studies in this project show limited comparison between modalities, which is informative of the role of connectivity in these effects. However, independently these studies provide novel information on the mechanisms on sensorimotor oscillatory interaction. The pharmacological studies reveal that GABAergic modulation with zolpidem changes the neuronal oscillatory network activity in both healthy and pathological MI. Zolpidem enhances the power of ongoing oscillatory activity in both sensorimotor laminae and in healthy subjects. In contrast, zolpidem attenuates the “abnormal” beta oscillatory activity in the affected hemisphere in Parkinsonian patients, while restoring the hemispheric beta power ratio and frequency variability and thereby improving motor symptomatology. Finally we show that independent signals from MI laminae can be integrated in silico to resemble the aggregate MEG MI oscillatory signals. This highlights the usefulness of combining these two methods when elucidating neuronal network oscillations in the sensorimotor cortex and any interventions.	 Thesis or dissertation	612.8	575443	0

 'Behind God's back' : a study of religion in the Bathsheba area of Barbados	 Harding, P. L.	 Swansea University 	 University College of Swansea	1981	 An ethnographic account of religious behaviour and domestic organisation in a lower-class, Barbadian village has been undertaken to contribute to the solution of the perrenial problem of stratification in the Caribbean. In keeping with other Caribbean community studies, household and familial groups are the focus of initial attention. The village is similar to others studied in that household structure varies both within the village and compared to other classes. Concensus and conflict models of society have been utilized to explain this phenomenon in previous studies. However the concepts used therein are found wanting in this case and an alternative framework is introduced which involves locating stratification by sex and are at village level within the context of island-wide stratification in the conventional sense. Domestic organisation is related to religious behaviour through a consideration of social stratification. Social anthropological contributions to stratification are reviewed, synthesised yet found inadequate. For heuristic purposes, a Marxian type approach is adopted in which the household is viewed as the unit of reproduction of labour power. Together with the primary process of production, this secondary process is seen as a means of conceptualising aspects of Barbadian social life. Each process is said to yield a system of stratification, positions in which are determined by the relations of production and reproduction of labour power respectively. The characteristics of local religious institutions are then described both synchronically and diachronically. The distinctive feature is found to be the predominance of females over males and of young and old over mature adult at all religious gatherings. Finally an attempt is made to explain the function of religious involvement for villagers, alternatively, as signifying the occupancy of a prestigious social position or as a means of adjusting to the occupancy of a marginal, liminal or inferior social position within one or other system of stratification.

 Analysis, modeling and wide-area spatiotemporal control of low-frequency sound reproduction	 Hill, Adam J.	 University of Essex	 University of Essex	2012	This research aims to develop a low-frequency response control methodology capable of delivering a consistent spectral and temporal response over a wide listening area. Low-frequency room acoustics are naturally plagued by room-modes, a result of standing waves at frequencies with wavelengths that are integer multiples of one or more room dimension. The standing wave pattern is different for each modal frequency, causing a complicated sound field exhibiting a highly position-dependent frequency response. Enhanced systems are investigated with multiple degrees of freedom (independently-controllable sound radiating sources) to provide adequate low-frequency response control. The proposed solution, termed a chameleon subwoofer array or CSA, adopts the most advantageous aspects of existing room-mode correction methodologies while emphasizing efficiency and practicality. Multiple degrees of freedom are ideally achieved by employing what is designated a hybrid subwoofer, which provides four orthogonal degrees of freedom configured within a modest-sized enclosure. The CSA software algorithm integrates both objective and subjective measures to address listener preferences including the possibility of individual real-time control. CSAs and existing techniques are evaluated within a novel acoustical modeling system (FDTD simulation toolbox) developed to meet the requirements of this research. Extensive virtual development of CSAs has led to experimentation using a prototype hybrid subwoofer. The resulting performance is in line with the simulations, whereby variance across a wide listening area is reduced by over 50% with only four degrees of freedom. A supplemental novel correction algorithm addresses correction issues at select narrow frequency bands. These frequencies are filtered from the signal and replaced using virtual bass to maintain all aural information, a psychoacoustical effect giving the impression of low-frequency. Virtual bass is synthesized using an original hybrid approach combining two mainstream synthesis procedures while suppressing each method‟s inherent weaknesses. This algorithm is demonstrated to improve CSA output efficiency while maintaining acceptable subjective performance.

 Equity of geographic access to specialist patient hospices within the United Kingdom	 Wood, David Justin	 Lancaster University	 Lancaster University	2010	Aim: As adult specialist inpatient hospice provision in the United Kingdom has matured, interest in the question of 'access' to care has grown. The evidence base on geographic accessibility is limited. This study examines whether geographic and socio-demographic accessibility to, and utilisation of, specialist inpatient hospices is equitable. Methods: A selective literature review critically examines the evidence on access to specialist inpatient hospices and specialist palliative care services. Inequalities in the availability of specialist inpatient hospices across the United Kingdom are summarised, analysed and mapped using a geographic information system. The geographic supply of, and demand for, adult specialist inpatient hospices across England and Wales are mapped by small area, and related to levels of deprivation. Specialist inpatient hospice accessibility scores are derived using a Newtonian distance decay model that analyses drive times between 189 inpatient hospices and 34,378 small areas. Inequities in access to specialist inpatient hospices are mapped. The utilisation of specialist inpatient hospices, across England, is examined for a variety of patient groups. A multivariate binary logistic regression analysis, undertaken on 378,482 adult cancer death records, models whether access, deprivation, age, gender and region influence the likelihood of dying in a specialist inpatient hospice. Results: A complex interaction of geographic, socio-demographic, healthcare system, clinical need, personal, cultural, societal and political factors impacts on the accessibility and utilisation of specialist inpatient hospices. Widespread regional variations in the geographic availability of specialist inpatient hospices are revealed. The highest levels of geographic access to adult specialist inpatient hospices are found within major urban conurbations, where cancer patients may potentially access alternative hospices with high bed numbers. Local examples of inequitable access are observed within neighbourhoods of many cities and towns, and across rural fringe counties. Over 6% of adults live at least 30 minutes from a specialist inpatient hospice. Once effects attributable to other variables are accounted for, significant gradients are shown, nationally, by decile of accessibility, relative level of affluence or deprivation, and age, in the likelihood of dying in a specialist inpatient hospice. Notable geographical 'distance decay' effects are clear within the most inaccessible and accessible areas. For 80% of patients, a gradual gradient in utilisation, by decile of accessibility, is shown, though patients from the most accessible decile of areas are 2.79 times more likely to die in a specialist inpatient hospice than are those from least accessible areas. There is evidence of 'inverse care' effects, whereby patients with potentially greater levels of need, show lower utilisation ratios. Patients from the most affluent decile of areas are 1.38 times more likely to die in a specialist inpatient hospice than are those from the poorest areas. The youngest decile banding of patients are 3.86 times more likely to die in a specialist inpatient hospice than the most elderly banding. Implications: Inequitable geographic access has implications for the establishment of future specialist inpatient hospices and integrated models of specialist palliative care.

 Consuming Latin America : the ¡Viva! Film Festival and imagined cosmopolitan communities	 Astudillo-Jones, Nicola Ann	 University of Manchester	 University of Manchester	2016	This thesis examines how Latin America is produced and consumed through the ¡Viva! Spanish and Latin American Film Festival in Manchester and how people who do not have Latin American origins (subsequently ‘non-Latin American’) use Latin American culture to reconcile issues of self-identity and cosmopolitanism at a local level. Extending Dina Iordanova’s (2010) application of imagined communities to film festivals beyond diaspora, a framework of imagined cosmopolitan communities finds that, through consumption of the ¡Viva! film festival, non-Latin American consumers can often feel a sense of belonging or connection to Latin American people and culture. Non-Latin American ¡Viva! consumers subsequently incorporate Latin American culture and identity within their own construction of self-identity in order to reaffirm their sense of self. Using a mixed methods approach which brings together qualitative research (including a questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews) with media analysis, this thesis finds that the incorporation of Latin American identity into non-Latin American self-identity is facilitated, in part, by the way in which Latin America has been encoded at a discursive level in the UK in recent decades through magical realism and associated codes, themes and narratives concerning the region’s bizarre, crazy, strange and surreal characteristics. Applying theories of encoding and decoding (Hall, 1980), the ¡Viva! film festival and its non-Latin American audience members are found to likewise construct Latin America in these terms, as different, but not too different from British cultural norms. This interpretive framework, along with the fact that Latin Americans are largely positioned outside of the increasingly hostile rhetoric towards migrants and ethnic minorities in the UK, facilitates the incorporation of a Latin American identity within non-Latin American consumers’ construction of self-identity. Scholars have suggested that cosmopolitanism demands a transformation in self-understanding in addition to an openness towards the cultural Other (Delanty, 2009). Analysis of the ¡Viva! film festival subsequently reveals a nuanced form of cosmopolitanism in which the Self is transformed through the incorporation of the Latin American cultural Other and offers an insight into the changing nature of the cultural relationship between Latin America and the UK. Latin America has typically been constructed as embodying the unconscious fears and desires of British (and western) culture (Beasley-Murray, 2003; Foster, 2009). This thesis finds instead that Latin America is being reconfigured by non-Latin American consumers of the ¡Viva! film festival as an equally formative part of their conscious identity that completes their sense of self and of being cosmopolitan in an attempt to resist and challenge contemporary scepticism and rhetoric in the UK surrounding multiculturalism, immigration and ethnic minorities.

 Intra-household allocation of time and money	 Ko, Ivor	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2012	There are four parts to this thesis: the first chapter analyses the structure of leisure in couples with particular emphasis on joint leisure. We take a structural approach and model the household as a two-stage decision making unit. The findings suggest that couples see joint leisure as a distinct good from private leisure. Specifically when a household decides to have more leisure, almost 40 percent of this increase is allocated to joint leisure as opposed to only 8 to 15 percent allocated to male private leisure. Furthermore, couples prefer to spend leisure together (synchronisation) relative to spending time independently, giving joint leisure the largest weight in the utility function. The findings further suggest that demographics can play a large role in determining the patterns of spousal leisure, with ethnicity and job characteristics being important factors. Finally, when analysing weekend time use patterns, there is evidence to suggest that Saturdays should be distinguished from Sundays as approximately 41 percent more joint leisure is observed on Sundays. The second chapter of the thesis begins our examination of the UK income taxation reform in 1990. The UK went from a system of joint taxation to independent taxation of couples and this reform may have had important implications for households. Across countries, there is a large variation in the income tax treatment of couples. Over the last three decades, many countries have undergone reforms in their tax systems, some have moved from joint to independent taxation, some from independent to joint, while others have begun the practice of allowing couples to choose the system they prefer. This chapter aims to give an overview of the tax treatment of couples and outlines the differences across countries, with particular emphasis on the tax reform in the UK. The third chapter investigates the UK income taxation reform in 1990 and examines how the change from a system of joint to independent taxation of couples has shifted women's relative earning potentials in the household, and how this in turn has led to changes in intra-household assignable clothing expenditures. I apply my method to a sample of UK couples with children and the findings of this chapter show that an exogenous increase in women's income relative to their spouse significantly and substantially increases female clothing expenditure and decreases male clothing expenditure ceteris paribus. However an increase in relative female earnings does not necessarily mean that children will do better relatively. The final outcome may depend on the type of transfer in question. In addition, there is evidence that the final allocations of expenditures on each partner and children may depend significantly on distribution factors such as spousal relative incomes, age gap and educational gap, despite the fact that these variables do not impact on preferences nor on budgets directly. This provides further evidence against the unitary framework in favour of the collective approach and the sharing rule interpretation of how households make decisions in practice. The final chapter of this thesis examines the effects of the tax reform in 1990 with particular emphasis on female labour supply. A method of clarifying the concept of a spouse's individual net income under a joint tax regime is proposed and following the methodology of Blundell et al (2007), the labour supply elasticities for both male and female are estimated. The analysis is extended further to include children in the model and the results show that both the number of children and their age are highly significant for women's labour supply and to a smaller extent also for men. Testing the income pooling hypothesis, the unitary model is not rejected. However, the results strongly reject the hypothesis that distribution factors have no effect on labour supply. The results also suggest that for the group of women affected, the reform generated two opposing effects on their labour supply: a positive effect from an increase in net wage and a negative effect from an increase in bargaining power. On balance, we find that a typical female decreased her labour supply by approximately 2.6 hours per week, yet she still experienced a 22 percent increase in her net income.

 Barriers to gene flow : a Bombina (fire-bellied toad) hybrid zone and multilocus cline theory	 Kruuk, Loeske E. B.	 University of Edinburgh	 University of Edinburgh	1997	1. In a stable hybrid zone between two taxa, natural selection creates a barrier to gene flow which counterbalances the homogenising effects of dispersal and interbreeding. Studies of hybrid zones can contribute to our understanding of the nature of reproductive isolation between two populations, and hence of speciation mechanisms. For example, reproductive isolation may be generated by natural selection acting against alleles in the wrong environment or against alleles in the wrong genetic background. In this thesis, I consider these issues with (i) a study of a hybrid zone between the fire-bellied toads Bombina bombina and B. variegata and (ii) development of analytical and simulation models of geographical variation maintained by dines at multiple loci. 2. In a transect across the Bombina hybrid zone in Croatia, the pattern of change in three phenotypic traits (leg length, belly pattern and egg size) corresponds to the stepped dines observed in previous studies of diagnostic allozyme loci. There is close concordance between the mean values of the traits and between estimates of linkage disequilibrium calculated from associations between alternative phenotypic and genetic variables. Clines in allozyme frequency and spot score are wider in males than in females, suggesting differential dispersal patterns. 3. There is direct evidence for hybrid dysfunction in the field: in samples collected from Bombina breeding sites, embryonic mortality, larval mortality and frequency of larval developmental abnormalities all increase significantly towards the centre of the hybrid zone. However, a cohort analysis of adult toads within a central region shows no evidence of differential mortality with respect to genotype. 4. Bombina bombina and B. variegata typically use different breeding habitats, with B. variegata showing strong avoidance of the semi-permanent ponds favoured by B. bombina. The abundance of aquatic predators is shown to differ between the alternative breeding habitats preferred by either species. Behavioural experiments show that the feeding strategy of B. bombina larvae reduces their risk of predation, relative to that of B. variegata larvae, thus demonstrating an adaptive advantage to the adults habitat preference. As the availability of either habitat type changes across the zone, these adaptations imply that differential adaptation across an environmental gradient is also creating a barrier to gene flow between the taxa. 5. An analytical model of multilocus dines maintained by differential adaptation to alternative environments is developed, considering in particular the effect of selection on neutral markers. The dynamics are qualitatively similar to those of previous models of heterozygote disadvantage. Computer simulations are used to test the analytical predictions, and the restrictions imposed by assumptions of weak selection. These show that while dine shape can accurately estimate parameters such as fitness in hybrid populations, others, such as the number of genes under selection, may be less robust. 6. The effect of a habitat preference in a hybrid zone such as Bombina is explored with a simulation model. Pooling across habitats, overall statistical associations increase with preference strength, illustrating the effect of the habitat preference in maintaining the integrity of the parental genomes. However, the resulting magnitude of linkage disequilibrium and deviations from Hardy-Weinberg proportion within habitats vary nonmonotonically with the strength of the preference. The resulting shape of the zone will be largely dependent on the underlying distribution of habitat availability. 7. The Bombina hybrid zone is therefore maintained by both endogenous and exogenous selection. Although theoretical models show that the dynamics of either regime are similar, the results imply that divergence during allopatry has been driven by adaptation to alternative environments, rather than solely non-adaptive factors. The resulting reproductive isolation has therefore been, at least partially, determined by ecological factors, and environmentally-mediated factors such as a habitat preference will generate further barriers to gene flow between two populations.

 Generating microcystin antibodies by phage display	 Drever, Matthew	 University of Aberdeen	 University of Aberdeen	2007	A naïve human antibody fragment phage display library was screened against conjugated microcystin-LR (MCLR).  Phage antibodies were eluted with free MCLR to promote the isolation of free antigen binders.  Isolated antibody fragments were cloned into a soluble expression vector and single-chain antibody (scAb) expressed in a bacterial host.  All scAbs bound free antigen in an indirect competition ELISA and levels of sensitivity were determined.  The most responsive clone 3A8 had an 800-fold increase in sensitivity to MCLR than previously documented scAbs and was able to detect levels below guidelines for MCLR in drinking water set by the World Health Organisation (WHO) at 1 μg/L.  Despite its sensitivity to MCLR, full characterisation revealed low levels of cross-reactivity with other microcystin variants.

 Neurocognitive signatures of auditory and visual sensory gating	 Jones, Laura	 Anglia Ruskin University	 Anglia Ruskin University	2016	The aim of this thesis was to investigate the neurophysiological phenomenon of auditory and visual sensory gating, and primarily, explore the notion of a cross-modal mechanism. The electrophysiological characterisation and associated cognitive functions of both visual and auditory sensory gating were examined to determine similarities and differences across the two input modalities. In order to explore this, three issues were addressed: 1) The latency and surface scalp location(s) of the maximal or most reliable sensory gating was identified; 2) the associated cognitive mechanism(s) were explored using 11 diverse tasks incorporating attentional inhibition; 3) the sensitivity of the gating mechanism was examined with regards to changes in stimulus form/location or changes in attentional demand. Despite limited consideration in the literature to date, this thesis reports evidence that sensory gating is a phenomenon that exists within the visual modality and moreover, can be reliably observed. Compared to standard auditory gating procedures, visual gating is found at a later latency and further back in the central-parietal or central-occipital electrode sites. Correlations between visual and auditory gating with latent inhibition and the continuous performance task suggests gating, independent of iii modality, may reflect the encoding of target and non-target stimuli/stimulus features alike, and the subsequent categorisation and inhibition of those deemed irrelevant. Additionally, a comparable limitation was observed for both modalities, with regards to sensitivity of sensory gating, with spatial features being processed as a priority over the perceptual stimulus features. In conclusion, the differences in latency and component of the observed gating presented in this thesis, indicates that visual and auditory sensory gating are not products of the same intra-cortical mechanism.

 Power scaling of Tm:YLF-pumped Ho:YAG lasers	 So, Sik	 University of Southampton	 University of Southampton	2007	Reported in this thesis are methodologies for power-scaling Ho:YAG lasers for both the continuous-wave (CW) and Q-switched regime. Advancement in Ho:YAG laser power is made possible through the improvements in output power of the Tm:YLF pump lasers. The slab geometry provides good thermal management characteristics which helps to overcome the limitations set by the thermally-induced stress fracture when scaling output power of Tm:YLF lasers. In conjunction with the use of novel holmium cavity designs that allow the use of slab pump lasers, high-power Ho:YAG lasers are realised. of 18.3 x 3.3. The slope efficiency was 61 % with respect to the thulium incident power, and the lasing wavelength was 2090 nm. Pulse energies as high as 14 mJ were achieved when Q-switched at 20 Hz, with a pulse duration of 17 ns. Further future improvements in output power and beam quality are also discussed.

 African women writers and the politics of gender	 Zulfiqar Chaudhry, Sadia	 University of Glasgow	 University of Glasgow	2014	 This thesis examines the work of a group of African women writers who have emerged over the last forty years. While figures such as Chinua Achebe, Ben Okri and Wole Soyinka are likely to be the chief focus of discussions of African writing, female authors have been at the forefront of fictional interrogations of identity formation and history. In the work of authors such as Mariama Bâ (Senegal), Buchi Emecheta (Nigeria), Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie (Nigeria), Tsitsi Dangarembga (Zimbabwe), and Leila Aboulela (Sudan), there is a clear attempt to subvert the tradition of male writing where the female characters are often relegated to the margins of the culture, and confined to the domestic, private sphere. This body of work has already generated a significant number of critical responses, including readings that draw on gender politics and colonialism; but it is still very much a minor literature, and most mainstream western feminism has not sufficiently processed it. The purpose of this thesis is threefold. First, it draws together some of the most important and influential African women writers of the post-war period and looks at their work, separately and together, in terms of a series of themes and issues, including marriage, family, polygamy, religion, childhood, and education. Second, it demonstrates how African literature produced by women writers is explicitly and polemically engaged with urgent political issues that have both local and global resonance: the veil, Islamophobia and a distinctively African brand of feminist critique. Third, it revisits Fredric Jameson’s claim that all third-world texts are ‘national allegories’ and considers these novels by African women in relation to Jameson’s claim, arguing that their work has complicated Jameson’s assumptions.

 Does it take an expert to lead experts? : professionals versus managers in universities	 Goodall, Amanda	 University of Warwick	 University of Warwick	2007	This is an empirical study of leaders and how they affect organizational performance. Its context is the research university as a knowledge intensive organization. It appears to be the first of its kind. The thesis explores whether the characteristics of a leader in position today can tell us about the future success of their institution. It asks the question: Should research universities be led by top scholars? One reason why universities are an interesting case is that, unusually for knowledge-intensive organizations, their leaders' technical expertise can arguably be measured reasonably objectively. Using cross-sectional analysis, the first approach adopted in this thesis is to identify whether accomplished scholars are currently leading the world's top universities and business schools. It demonstrates -- using a variety of data sets, and in a variety of settings, including a check on the role of outliers -- that better universities and business schools are led by presidents and deans with systematically higher numbers of life-time scholarly citations. Next the dissertation attempts to go beyond simple cross-sectional patterns to address the question of causality. It does so in a longitudinal study that follows the performance of a panel of 55 universities over a nine-year period from 1992 to 2001. Using regression analysis, this thesis uncovers some evidence that is consistent with the existence of a causal relationship between the research ability of a leader and the future achievement of their institution. The results suggest that a university tends to improve in the UK Research Assessment Exercise if its leader has been a successful scholar. Qualitative evidence in the form of interviews with university leaders then motivates a theory of strategic leadership that might explain the statistical patterns. It is argued in the thesis that scholars may make effective leaders for reasons that are both internal and external to the individual. A scholar-leader, it is suggested, influences performance because of an inherent knowledge of the core business of a research university, and also through the extension of powers acquired by being viewed as credible by followers. Finally, the thesis concludes by asking whether university governing bodies appoint the right people. The central argument being made in this thesis is that where expert knowledge is the key factor that characterises an organization it is expert knowledge that should also be key in the selection of its leader.

 Load/deformation/time behaviour of articular cartilage	 Snaith, Jane E.	 Durham University	 Durham University	1976	 This thesis is concerned with the behaviour of articular cartilage under compressive loading. An apparatus was built to apply sinusoidal and constant loading to specimens of cartilage. The majority of the tests performed were on specimens of bovine cartilage although some tests have been conducted on human patella cartilage. Confined tests, with load, deformation and flow confined to an axial direction, were considered most realistic to the conditions in the body, and so the majority of the work was on this type of test. However some tests of an 'unconfined' nature, with axial load but radial flow and deformation, were carried out. An already established computer model of this behaviour of cartilage was modified and used to reproduce the experimental results. The model is based on fluid flow phenomena only and hence agreement with the experimental work was not entirely satisfactory. However, the model does allow the effect of changes in cartilage properties to be studied. The model yielded its most useful results for sinusoidal loading, where it forecast similar results to the experimental work. The cartilage is shown to be visco-elastic under conditions of steady load, the creep deformation being achieved by fluid flowing out of the specimen. The creep deformation is shown to be recoverable on removal of load. Under sinusoidal loading, around the frequency of the walking cycle, flow processes are shown to contribute practically nothing to the sinusoidal deformations achieved, the deformations in this case arising almost entirely from the elastic compressibility of the specimens.

 Polydispersity effects on colloidal phase transitions and kinetic arrest	 Liddle, Siobhan Mary	 University of Edinburgh	 University of Edinburgh	2014	I have studied the effects of polydispersity in systems of hard-sphere, colloidal PMMA particles with and without short-range attraction. In hard-sphere, colloidal systems, the parameter controlling phase behaviour is Ø , the volume fraction of colloids in the solvent. As Ø increases in polydisperse systems, theory predicts a transition from a single phase fluid to a fluid coexisting with a solid (crystal), to a fluid coexisting with multiple solid phases. By considering a volume fraction series of particles with 12% polydispersity and comparing the results with previous experimental results and predictions of the volume fractions within the coexistence regions, we concluded that this system may be exhibiting both fluid-solid and fluid-solid-solid behaviour within the experimental coexistence region. Theory also predicts that coexisting phases in polydisperse hard-sphere systems will fractionate: they will contain different particle size distributions (psds). This was investigated by directly measuring psds for one sample within the coexistence region at different time points. The results show that no statistically significant size fractionation was present after 28 days but by 120 days the solid phase contained a slightly narrower distribution of larger particles than the coexisting fluid phase. At higher than the coexistence region in this polydisperse system, the expected coexisting solids are not observed. Instead, a novel, non-equilibrium phase is present. The dynamics were probed using 3-dimensional dynamic light scattering, which confirmed the non-equilibrium nature of the phase: significant dynamical heterogeneities and anomalous ageing behaviour were present. These experimental dynamics are compared with dynamics obtained from simulations of different hard-sphere psds, including the experimental particle size distribution. The effect of adding a short-range, depletion attraction to a polydisperse colloidal system was systematically explored. Phase boundaries and the position of the metastable gas-liquid binodal were determined experimentally. The resultant phase diagram topology is qualitatively different to a system of monodisperse particles with the same attraction range. Furthermore, within the metastable binodal region, three-phase gas-liquid-solid samples were observed, which is neither an equilibrium or metastable state in monodisperse systems. The coexisting samples were again characterised using electron microscopy and also small-angle x-ray scattering, which revealed significant size fractionation in the gas-liquid separated samples but not in the samples which eventually crystallised.

 Experimental investigation of thermal conductivity of soils and borehole grouting materials	 Alrtimi, Abdulbaset Ahmed	 University of Newcastle upon Tyne	 University of Newcastle upon Tyne	2014	Exploitation of thermogeology energy in heating and cooling of buildings starts to spread worldwide as an alternative renewable source of heat energy. The thermal conductivity of soils is among the critical parameters required to achieve a proper design of ground heat exchangers or any underground systems that involve thermo-active processes. This research is a part of study related to the laboratory measurements of thermal conductivity of soils and thermal grouts used for borehole heat exchangers. The first part of this project involves a design of a new thermal cell that can be used to measure the thermal conductivity of soils. The design of the apparatus is based on the application of Fourier’s law at steady state condition where unidirectional heat flux is generated through two identical specimens. A new concept of minimizing the radial heat losses that occur due to the ambient temperature interface (ATI) using a thermal jacket as a heat insulation barrier has been introduced in the design and experimentally performed. The obtained results and the analysis of the heat flow reveal that the longitudinal heat flow can be maximized and the radial heat flow can be minimized when the thermal jacket is used with proper temperature control. Also, it has been revealed that the measured thermal conductivity of soils is sensitive to further boundary conditions such as thermocouples and temperature of sink disks. In addition to its simplicity, the new cell can be used for undisturbed field samples (U100 samples) as well as laboratory-prepared specimens. The sample preparation and the test procedure for the two different soil conditions highlighted the simplicity of using the new apparatus in measurement of the thermal conductivity of soils. The second part of this research concerns a production of new thermal grout for borehole heat exchangers using unwanted industrial and domestic materials (PFA and ground glass-low cost) and the commodity fluorspar, all of which have relatively high thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity of different PFA based grouts that comprise different enhancing materials at different mix proportions has been measured dry and at saturation using the new thermal call. The results highlighted the effect of mineralogy and the particle size distribution of the mix constituents on the thermal conductivity of the grout. The results showed that a combination of fluorspar with coarse ground glass can provide good thermal enhancement in both dry and saturated conditions. The grout that consist of 20% cement, 30% PFA, 15% coarse ground glass and 35% fluorspar by weight with dry and saturated thermal conductivity of 1.283 and 1.985 W/m respectively can be considered as a suitable grout that can be used successfully in UK. Comparing with thermally enhanced bentonite (1.46 W/m.K), it is expected that with London Clay Formation optimal performance of borehole heat exchangers and cost savings would be achieved using the selected grout. The work done in the final part can be considered as an application of the new steady state thermal cell in the estimation of the thermal conductivity of sandy soils. Also, it can be considered as a case study where the thermal conductivity was measured for soils that have not been previously thermally tested (Tripoli sand). The effects of the porosity and degree of saturation on the thermal conductivity of Tripoli sand were investigated. The results of twenty experimental tests showed that the effect of the saturation degree is significant compared with the effect of dry density especially at saturation degree less that 10%. Also, the results revealed that the thermal conductivity is approximately linearly proportional to the dry density at all levels of saturation. The validation of some existing selected prediction models showed that none of the selected models is able to correctly match the thermal conductivity of Tripoli sand at all conditions. However, some models were more accurate than others in certain conditions. It is also concluded that all presented models failed to estimate the thermal conductivity of such soil in low or partially saturated conditions where convection started to play a role in the heat transfer mode. On the other hand, the variation of thermal conductivity of Tripoli sand can be fittingly described as logarithmic function of the water content at all levels of porosity with R2 value ranges between 0.9694 and 0.9732. As a result, an empirical model based on the experimental results expressing the thermal conductivity in terms of water content and porosity has been obtained and validated.

 Construction-based metaheuristics for personnel scheduling problems	 Goodman, Melissa D.	 Cardiff University	 Cardiff University	2007	 This thesis investigates the idea of balancing different constraints in order to find optimal solutions to two personnel scheduling problems, within the framework of constructive metaheuristic approaches. The two problems considered are a nurse scheduling problem, for which finding feasible solutions is known to be difficult and for which the hard and soft constraints are in direct conflict, and a medical student scheduling problem for which there is little relevant literature this second problem also has conflicting hard and soft constraints, but presents further conflict between the different soft constraints. The methods used to solve these problems are focused on two constructive metaheuristics in particular: Greedy Randomised Adaptive Search Procedures (GRASP) and Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) and for each approach several construction heuristics are introduced and compared. Using GRASP, a number of local search neighbourhoods are established for each problem, while for ACO the suitability of three trail definitions are compared. In order to further explore the balance which may obtained between the different constraints and objectives for the two problems, hybrid constructions are investigated, incorporating exact methods which take advantage of the underlying structures of each problem with regards to feasibility. For medical student scheduling, this exact method was developed into a new type of construction mechanism providing much improved results over a standard heuristic approach. Further enhancements investigated include the use of problem-specific feedback for nurse scheduling and the use of an intelligent memory procedure for the medical student scheduling problem. For the nurse scheduling problem, the final algorithm developed was able to rival the best in the literature so far and produce optimal solutions for all available datasets. For the medical student scheduling problem, optimal solutions are not known, but the results obtained are very promising and provide a good basis for further study of the problem.

 Measuring career anchors and investigating the role of career anchor congruence	 Steele, Catherine A.	 Coventry University	 Coventry University in collaboration with the University of Worcester	2009	This thesis empirically examines the career orientations inventory (COI) as a measure of career anchors and then, using this measure, it goes on to investigate the relationship between career anchor congruence and work related outcomes, specifically job satisfaction and organisational commitment. The psychometric properties of the 40 item COI (presented by Igbaria and Baroudi, 1993) were explored by the administration of the measure to a sample of 658 individuals from 27 organisations in the UK. Through factor analysis an eight factor structure was demonstrated in line with that proposed by Schein (1993). The factor structure was replicated with a second sample. The COI demonstrated good levels of internal consistency (.59-.83) and test retest reliability (.68-.90). Similarly it was deemed to have acceptable levels of face validity and construct validity when compared to Mantech’s (1983) Work Values Questionnaire (WVQ). An analysis of the prevalence of career anchors and the demographic differences within the current sample was undertaken. This analysis provided evidence to suggest that certain career anchors may be increasing in prevalence while others are decreasing. These findings are in line with current research on the way in which workplace changes are impacting upon careers (Baruch, 2004). Evidence was found that indicated gender differences in scores on the COI subscales. Specifically women were found to score higher on the lifestyle anchor and men to score higher on the general management anchor. Differences were also found between the age groups considered in this study in the general management, creativity, pure challenge and lifestyle anchors. Interaction effects for age and gender were found for the general management and sense of service anchors. The COI was then used to develop a commensurate measure of job career anchors. This job career anchor measure discriminated between jobs within one police organisation. The measure was then used to explore the relationship between career anchors, career anchor congruence (congruence between individual and job career anchors), job satisfaction and organisational commitment. Evidence was found to suggest that career anchors and career anchor congruence have a direct effect on job satisfaction (predicting 10% and 4% of the variance respectively). The analysis also showed support for the role of career anchor congruence as a moderator to the relationship between career anchors and job satisfaction. This thesis makes full consideration of the academic contributions and practical implications of the research presented whilst also considering its limitations. A number of suggestions for the direction of future research have been made.

Freedom and authority in Church and society : Maude Dominica Petre 1863-1942	 Wilcox, Graham James	 University of Birmingham	 University of Birmingham	2010	 Maude Petre is a somewhat neglected figure mentioned today chiefly in regard to her association with the Catholic Modernist, George Tyrrell. The aim of the thesis will be to strive to retrieve her from this neglect by showing that she was a significant figure in her own right with a substantial body of published work. Attention will be given in particular to her writings in the later years of her life in which little interest has hitherto been shown. The thesis will endeavour to trace her main ideas as expressed in her published works and see how they developed over the course of her long life. The issue of authority and liberty in Church and society will be highlighted as one of the dominant themes of her writing. Her life and thought will be placed in the context of her age and its many changes both in Church and society and her writings will be related to the events of her own life as recorded in her own diaries. An attempt will be made in conclusion to evaluate the wider significance of her life and thought.	 Thesis or dissertation	 BR Christianity ; BL Religion	516007	0

The roles of Factor XIII-A and Transglutaminase 2 in the vasculature	 Simpson, Kingsley	 University of Leeds	 University of Leeds	2017	Transglutaminases catalyse the formation of isopeptide bonds which covalently link proteins together and these enzymes have been previously implicated in cardiovascular repair processes. This thesis explores the transglutaminases, Factor (F)XIII-A and Transglutaminase (TG)2, and their roles within the vasculature. To do this, we bred and characterised single and double knockout mice deficient for FXIII A and/or TG2. Previously, a protective role has been postulated for FXIII-A, as humans and mice lacking FXIII-A fail to maintain pregnancy potentially due to a failure of remodelling within the placental artery. This finding was also repeated in this study and further to this a significant decrease in the number of FXIII-A-/- pups born to FXIII-A+/- mothers was seen. FXIII-A-/- mice develop cardiac fibrosis and suffer significant mortality following injury and this phenotype is exacerbated with additional loss of TG2, highlighting the importance of FXIII A and TG2 as protective enzymes. Interestingly, despite being present in the blood at μg/mL concentrations, the cellular source that maintains the plasma pool of FXIII-A has not been identified. FXIII-A is known to be produced by megakaryocytes, chondrocytes, osteoclasts, monocytes and macrophages and the prevailing view is that platelets are the most likely cellular source. To delineate the cellular source of plasma FXIII-A, we commissioned a de novo FXIII A floxed mouse which was bred with tissue specific cre recombinase mice. These novel models were used to determine plasma and platelet FXIII-A activity, together with FXIII-A gene expression in the aorta and heart. The results presented here discount the platelet as the cellular source of plasma FXIII A. Mouse bone marrow transplants and gene expression in whole and fractionated organs instead implicate a resident tissue cell, possibly a macrophage, in the wall of the aorta (and perhaps the heart) as the cellular source of FXIII A. Beyond its repair role, TG2 has been suggested to potentiate apoptosis in response to stress signalling. However, previous studies have utilised monodansylcadaverine and hence have not inhibited TG2 directly. Here, transglutaminase activity assays and characterisation of MAPK signalling in wildtype and TG2 /- derived vascular smooth muscle cells are used to demonstrate that TG2 is the main transglutaminase involved in calphostin C-induced apoptosis. The findings shown here explore the common and distinct functions of these enzymes and details potential avenues for translation into therapy.

 Tumour-specific CTLs : what does it take to wake them up?	 Yafei, Zain Al	 University of Bristol	 University of Bristol	2012	The immunosurveillance hypothesis states that the immune system recognises and responds to tumours preventing growth and progression and that tumour- infiltrating CD8+ T cells are essential component. However, most immune-based antitumour therapies have had limited efficacy in controlling tumour growth due to immunosuppression within the tumour microenvironment. Experiments described in this thesis were aimed at understanding mechanisms of tumour- mediated immunosuppression of antitumour CTL responses. Studies utilised a BALB/c mouse model comprising renal carcinoma cells (Renca), expressing the haemagglutinin (HA) protein from influenza virus AlPRl8/H1 NI(PR8) as tumour- specific neo-antigen, and transgenic CL4 CD8+ T cells, expressing a high affinity TcR specific for the dominant Kd-restricted epitope of HA. The data show that CL4 CD8+ T cells undergo productive activation (PA) in the tumour draining lymph nodes resulting in CTL responses. However, following migration into the tumour they lose effector function, which is accompanied by an increase in cell- surface expression of Ly6C. However, if the interaction of Ly6C with its unknown ligand is blocked under conditions that would otherwise result in abortive activation then PA is restored. Other studies revealed that endogenous tumour-infiltrating Iymphocytes (TIL) could suppress CL4 CTL activity by elaborating adenosine via CD39 and CD73 ecto-enzymes. However, suppression was prevented by antagonising the adenosine receptors. Further investigations revealed that expression of CD39 and CD73 by endogenous TIL is controlled by TGF-~. Several distinct populations of tumour-infiltrating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (Ti-MDSC) were also characterised based on cell-surface expression of different levels of Ly6C and Ly6G glycoproteins. Not only do their phenotypic profile and relative proportion change over time as the tumours progress, but these Ti-MDSC also express CD39 and CD73. These findings demonstrate that various mechanisms of immunosuppression operate within the tumour microenvironment. Therefore, although targeting individual mechanisms may potentially alleviate some of the suppression; enabling partial restoration of CTL activity, it is likely that only by targeting multiple mechanisms will we be able to fully restore CTL activity to such an extent that the tumour is eradicated.

 On conditional Wiener integrals and a novel approach to the fermion sign problem	 Dumas, Warwick Michael	 University of Leicester	 University of Leicester	2010	The path-integral formulation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics was introduced by Feynman in 1948. The use of Path Integral Monte Carlo can be put on a rigorous footing using conditional Wiener integrals. This thesis addresses the topics both of numerical error and of Monte Carlo error. A piecewise constant numerical method which is of second order of accuracy for computing conditional Wiener integrals for a rather general class of sufficiently smooth functional is proposed. The method is based on simulation of Brownian bridges via the corresponding stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and on ideas of the weak-sense numerical integration of SDEs. A convergence theorem is proved. Special attention is paid to integral-type functionals. Results of some numerical experiments are presented. In a further part of the research, the goal is to develop Monte Carlo methods for fermion simulations that are resistant to the explosion of variance which happens due to the fermion sign problem. A novel approach is developed which represents a radical departure from the current approaches. This is based on the principle of using a geometrical interpretation of the problem in order to find ways to maximize the negative covariance between the countersigned functional contributions. The fundamental connection between quantum exchange and the fermion sign problem is exploited. It is shown that this leads to a mathematical proof of the well-known exact solution to the sign problem for 1-dimensional fermion systems, and also to a novel exact solution in the case of a pair of 2-dimensional fermions.

 Risk management of U.S. banks in less developed countries : a country-risk analysis	 Martins, Henry Bola	 University of Sheffield	 University of Sheffield	1990	The object of this research is to determine whether U.S. commercial banks could have predicted in advance the debt crises of the developing countries, i.e., whether a particular LDC would reschedule or default on its loans. A secondary purpose was to determine whether the debt crisis was the fault of the banks or the developing countries who reneged on their loan contracts. What do the banks have to do to prevent this from happening? What do they have to do to manage country risk effectively? The study begins with a historical account of the United States banking system to the period of debt rescheduling by the LDCs. It continues by describing the different types of risks in international banking. Next it discusses the theoretical issues of LDC debt, including sustainability of debt policy, optimal level of country borrowing, optimal bank foreign lending, and credit rationing by the banks. This is followed by a description of the regulatory aspects of country risk management. The important issue of country risk management by U.S. banks is next, including a discussion of the various assessment methods used and a review of the major empirical studies that used econometric methods for predicting the incidence of external debt defaults. The empirical research investigates debt rescheduling by less developed countries. Linear discriminant function and logistic discrimination approaches were used to determine the predictive ability of any particular subset of economic variables. The sample comprises data on 37 countries over a period of 10 years, 1974-1983. This period was chosen because it was a time of important economic transition. The results of the discriminant and logistic analyses show modest discriminatory power for predicting the rescheduling of debt of a country with the set of economic predictors used.

 A study of the late twelfth and thirteenth centuries Byzantine architecture and painting : the Church of Krena in Chios	 Pennas, Charalampos	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2013	The subject of this dissertation is the study of the byzantine church of Krena in the island of Chios. The importance of the church lies not just in that it has survived virtually unspoilt in architectural terms, nor in that it preserves almost intact its original mural decoration, but in the fact that it belongs to the small group of precisely dated monuments of the late Komnenian period. A painted inscription in the narthex gives the date 1197, while the names of two Byzantine families of the period are encountered in the mural decoration of the church, namely the surnames Kodratos and Pagomenos. Hence, the study of the Byzantine church of Krena contributes to our understanding of the trends in Byzantine architecture and painting in the East Aegean region and the western Asia Minor during the end of the twelfth century, shortly before the Sack of Constantinople by the Latins. Moreover, the monument appears to constitute a key monument for the study of Byzantine art during the late twelfth century, expressing the new pictorial and aesthetic tendencies of the new era. The thesis is divided into the following main chapters: 1. HISTORICHAL FRAMEWORK First there is a brief history of Chios during the 11 th and 1 i h centuries. Taking into account the historical events of the period a comprehensive outline of the administrative, economic and social history of the island is attempted (1.1). Second, after a short reference to travelers' testimonies concerning the toponym Krena and the church of the Virgin itself (1.2), there is a detailed discussion of the founders' of the church, namely Eustathios Kodratos, and the Metropolitan of Hypaipa, Stephanos Pepagomenos, uncle of Kodratos' wife, a certain Pagomeni. The career of the two men is traced, as well as the social background of their families and their connection with the central imperial authority (1.3). Finally, there is the evidence of the inscriptions that exist on various marble architectural members, as well as in the painted decoration of the church. Except for the founders' inscriptions there are some others, which give precious infOlmation concerning the histOlY of the monument from the period of its foundation, at the end of the twelfth century, until the end of the nineteenth century (1.4). 2. ARCHITECTURE The chapter on the architecture deals first with a discussion on the origin of the domed octagon type, whose Krena is one of the latest dated examples (2.1). Next, there is a survey of the structural history of the church, focusing to its various architectural phases (2.2). Special references are made to the general structural features of the church (2.3). Domes, walls, openings either in the interior or in the exterior of the church, ceramoplastic decoration are examined in detail. An impOliant role for the original reconstruction of the upper parts of the church, after their destruction during the earthquake of 1881, plays the depicted model of the church offering from the founder Eustathios Kodratos to the Virgin. Finally, the contribution of Krena to the architecture of the twelfth century is discussed (2.4). Although, the main architectural type of Krena has its roots in a much earlier architectural film, not usual on the twelfth century, that of the octagon type, the monument employs new features which stress the plasticity of the exterior, making it a forerunner of Lascarid and consequently of Palaeologan architecture.

 Autophagosome maturation in primary rat hepatocytes	 Köchl, Robert	 University College London (University of London)	 University of London	2006	Nutrient deprivation of eukaryotic cells elicits a rapid survival response, including the induction of autophagy. Autophagy, or "self-eating", involves the formation of autophagosomes from an unknown membrane source and the sequestration of cytosolic components, including organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and small vesicles. Autophagosomes then fuse with protease-containing endosomes and their contents are degraded. This allows the cell to recycle amino acids and to reuse them for the synthesis of new proteins. To study the formation and fusion of autophagosomes, I have developed in vivo and in vitro assays, based on primary rat hepatocytes cultures. For the in vitro assay, the aim of which is to identify proteins involved in fusion, I have designed specific markers and internalized them into endosomes and autophagosomes. Both vesicle populations have been purified and used to reconstitute fusion in vitro. For the in vivo experiments I expressed the GFP-tagged autophagosomal marker, LC3, in cultured primary rat hepatocytes. By measuring the translocation of GFP-LC3 from a cytosolic pool to newly formed autophagosomes, using a high throughput-imaging system, and by assaying for the lipidation of GFP-LC3, I was able to quantify the rate and magnitude of autophagosome formation and fusion. Starvation led to an increase in the rate of autophagosome formation, and the total number of autophagosomes per cell increased more than two-fold. Autophagosome formation was independent of mTOR, a negative regulator of autophagy in yeast and many cell lines, and could be strongly inhibited by leucine, a regulatory amino acid. I then investigated the role of microtubules in the formation and fusion of autophagosomes, using the microtubule-depolymerising drugs nocodazole and vinblastine. I found that nocodazole treatment reduced the rate of autophagosome formation and completely inhibited their mobility. In addition, both drugs inhibited fusion with endosomes, showing that an intact microtubule network is also required for fusion. Interestingly, vinblastine also strongly stimulated autophagosome formation, even in nutrient-rich medium. This effect was independent of mTOR activity, but required the autophagy proteins Atg5 and Atg6, suggesting that vinblastine affects a novel signalling pathway upstream of autophagy proteins.

 Signal processing of nonlinear systems in the frequency domain	 Wu, Xiaofeng	 University of Sheffield	 Sheffield	2008	 In science and engineering fields, linear system theories have been well established both in the time and frequency domain and have wide applications in practice. The study of nonlinear systems has received increasing attention since the early twentieth century, because there are limitations of the use of linear systems in representing real systems especially in explaining important nonlinear phenomena such as harmonics and chaos.

 A comparative study on quality management in the Brazilian and the Scottish Prison Service	 Vieira, Marcelo Milano Falcão	 University of Edinburgh	 University of Edinburgh	1996	 This study identifies and compares quality perceptions and initiatives between the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) and the Brazilian Prison Service - Santa Catarina State (BPS-SC). The two organisations have specific approaches towards quality management. The SPS is involved in a formal quality management programme, whereas the BPS-SC quality is determined at a more abstract level. In the case of the SPS the impact of the quality management programme on the job structure (design and satisfaction) in different organisational levels, and in organisational control, is analysed in depth. In the case of the BPS-SC, significant structural aspects that determine quality perceptions and initiatives are identified and discussed. The study also considers the influences of the institutional environments in which each organisation operates in the shaping of quality perceptions and initiatives. Four case studies were conducted: two in Scotland and two in Brazil. The research strategy adopted is mostly qualitative, although some basic quantitative analysis is used. The case studies conducted were exploratory and descriptive. Data was collected by means of open-ended interviews, documentary analysis, informal interviews and participation in training sessions. The analysis of the data was conducted on a qualitative basis, and subjected to triangulation techniques. Clustering analysis techniques were also used in some cases. The results indicate that quality cannot be regarded as an universal concept. Quality definition and initiatives vary among and within organisational groups in the same context, as well as within the same organisational groups in different institutional contexts. In terms of the impact of the introduction of a formal quality programme on the job structure and control process of the SPS, the results demonstrate that quality management can provide a degree of a job enrichment and can also contribute to a re-skilling process. Although this contributes to the increase in job satisfaction, the general work environment is not necessarily improved.	 Thesis or dissertation	364	663273	0

Evidence for plant adaptation to a future high CO2 world	 Watson-Lazowski, Alexander	 University of Southampton	 University of Southampton	2015	Plant morphology and function are sensitive to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, but evidence that CO2 concentration can act as a selective pressure driving evolution is sparse. Plants originating from naturally high CO2 springs are subjected to elevated CO2 concentration over multiple generations, providing an opportunity to predict how adaptation to future atmospheres may occur, with important implications for future plant conservation and crop breeding strategies. Using Plantago lanceolata L. from such a site (the ‘spring’ site) and from an adjacent ambient CO2 site (‘control’ site), and growing the populations in ambient and elevated CO2 at 700 μmol mol-1, I have characterised, for the first time, the functional and population genomics, alongside morphology and physiology, of plant adaptation to elevated CO2 concentrations. Growing plants in elevated CO2 caused relatively modest changes in gene expression, with fewer changes evident in the spring than control plants (33 vs 131 genes differentially expressed [DE], in spring and control plants respectively). In contrast, when comparisons were made between control and spring plants grown in either ambient or elevated CO2, there were a much larger number of loci showing DE (689 in the ambient and 853 in the elevated CO2 environment). Population genomic analysis revealed that genetic differentiation between the	 Thesis or dissertation	 GE Environmental Sciences	668786	0
 The effect of modulating membrane lipid composition on the thermal sensitivity of tumour cells in culture	 Kingston, Catharine Alison	 Durham University	 Durham University	1989	The plasma membrane, which separates intracellular contents from extra cellular milieu, consists of a lipid bilayer comprising mainly phospholipids and cholesterol together with various functional proteins, which control the interaction of the cell with its environment. Cells are killed at elevated temperatures and previous work suggests that the plasma membrane may be a primary target in this hyperthermic cell death. The present study set out to test this hypothesis using a rat liver tumour cell hue (Hepatoma Tissue Culture cells). Several different experimental approaches were adopted. Supplementation of these cells with linoleic acid (18 : 2) for a 36 hour period increased the thermal sensitivity of cells at 43 C, though increased sensitivity was not evident at other times. Plasma membrane-enriched fractions were obtained from control cells and from cells supplemented with linoleic acid for a 36 hour period, then lipids were extracted and characterised. Whilst there was little difference in the cholesterol : phospholipid ratio, the phospholipid fatty acid composition of membranes from supplemented cells showed elevated levels of 18 : 2 and decreased levels of oleic acid (18 : 1) relative to control cell membranes. DPH fluorescence polarisation studies indicated that plasma membranes from supplemented cells were less 'ordered' than control membranes. Alkaline phosphodiesterase I, a plasma membrane-bound enzyme, appeared to be more thermolabile in supplemented cells suggesting that plasma membrane 'fluidity' may be an important factor in determining the thermal sensitivity of this membrane-bound enzyme. Hyperthermic cell death was potentiated by the presence of local anaesthetics, two of which, dibucaine and tetracaine, also produced less 'ordered' membranes. Morphological studies conducted on cells in the presence and absence of local anaesthetic at elevated temperatures indicated changes in cellular surface morphology on heating which were accelerated in the presence of the anaesthetic. The intermediate filament network of these cells did not appear to be a primary target of hyperthermic treatment. These studies suggest that the lipid composition and physical state of the plasma membrane are critical features involved in the expression of cell death, possibly through a modulation of membrane protein thermal sensitivity.

 Towards an anthropology of literature : the magic of hybrid fictions	 Aniballi, Francesca	 University of Glasgow	 University of Glasgow	2013	 Anthropology and literary criticism can interact fruitfully in the investigation of theoretical, general and specific issues concerning literature. Anthropological concepts of magic and ritual are useful to account for those fictions which defy neat labels and sit at the crossroad between the fantastic and the mimetic impulses. Furthermore, the reading process of such fictions can be interpreted as a liminal experience, whereby the reader’s consciousness is ritualized. Adopting a phenomenological stance and a socio-anthropological methodology, the thesis presents the author’s auto-ethnography of reading, also integrating the latest findings of cognitive linguistics and psychology of fiction into the theoretical reflection. Other conceptual tools, such as ideas concerning performative language, the hero quest and epiphany, metaphor and symbolism, are elaborated in order to illustrate the reading of ‘hybrid’ fictions, and how the reader is actively involved in the process. Moreover, three sample novels are analysed in the light of concepts of magic from a thematic and structural point of view, as texts which posit the issue of the de-reification of the real and of the imagination itself as a critique of the discourses of modernity. Overall the thesis supports an ecological view of the (literary) imagination, conceived as a relational process whereby nature and culture are seen as co-extensive and not in opposition to each other.

 Ecology and conservation of sea turtles in Peru	 Alfaro Shigueto, Joanna Olga Gissella	 University of Exeter	 University of Exeter	2012	Some of the key elements to assess the status of any wildlife population in a given geographical area are the levels of recruitment, survival and mortality. Whilst most of the information on marine turtles has been obtained from nesting sites, turtles spend most of their lives at sea. The conservation status of marine turtles in the southeast Pacific is poorly documented. This is particularly true for countries like Peru, where nesting events are very rare, although five species of turtles from populations from all over the Pacific basin, use these waters as foraging grounds. Little information exists on the threats to turtle populations in foraging areas or the magnitude of these impacts. Small-scale fisheries are a globally important economic activity serving as a source of food and employment for ca. 1 billion people; however we show that they also have serious impacts on marine turtle populations from all over the Pacific basin in the form of incidentally captured marine turtles. The five chapters that constitute this thesis are intended to increase our understanding of small-scale fisheries impacts on this taxon during their aquatic life stages. This work focuses on describing these fisheries, their impacts on marine turtles and proposes methodologies to monitor and assess the level of bycatch from small-scale fisheries. We also discuss alternative ways to prevent fisheries interactions and promote the involvement of artisanal fishermen in the southeast Pacific in implementing conservation solutions.

 Working together? : a survey of professional perceptions in child protection in England	 Birchall, Elizabeth	 University of Stirling	 University of Stirling	1993	This thesis presents findings from a postal survey in 1991, mainly in three diverse areas in the north of England. 339 members responded from six important professions in child protection: social workers, health visitors, teachers, police, general practitioners and paediatricians. The overall response rate was 60%. It explores practitioners' varied exposure to child protection training and experience of cases, their different severity ratings of brief vignettes of abuse, their thoughts and action proposals and choice of contacts in relation to an unfolding vignette, and their perceptions of local procedures and the functioning of their local child protection networks. The work rests on a literature review published in 1991 under the title Coordination and Child Protection: a review of the literature by Christine Hallett and myself. The general findings of the survey are that interprofessional cooperation and coordination are well accepted tenets among workers in the system and that most informed respondents believe the system works fairly well, particularly in the assessment stage. However, many people, particularly among teachers and general practitioners, revealed an extremely limited involvement in or knowledge of the system. A complex network is revealed. Social workers, specialist police and consultant paediatricians clearly emerge as the core but health visitors appear to be a crucial bridge between frontline agencies and the core professions. Many other professions and agencies appear to have peripheral or episodic involvement in cases. Despite the generally favourable view of the system's functioning, many points of tension and conflict are evident. These range from discrepant evaluations of cases through many other factors to competing priorities and resource shortfalls as obstacles to coordination. A number of proposals to ameliorate some of these tensions are put forward.	 Thesis or dissertation	 Child welfare England ; Social work with children England ; Interprofessional relations	335129	0
 Assessing ozone impacts on arable crops in South Asia : identification of suitable risk assessment methods to improve crop biotechnology	 Jamir, Chubamenla	 University of York	 University of York	2011	This study has applied a number of different O3 risk assessment methods in South Asia to assess the extent and magnitude of O3 risk to crops and investigate how appropriate different methods are in identifying local environmental conditions and crop physiological traits that might alter crop sensitivity to O3. Concentration based methods are used in combination with tools and datasets tailored for South Asian conditions to investigate O3 impacts on wheat, rice, soybean and potato. Relative yield losses are substantially smaller (0.1 to 11.5 %) than those found in previously conducted global modelling studies (3 to 30 %) which is attributed to the improved resolution of the O3 photochemical model and crop distribution datasets used in this South Asian analysis. For the first time O3 flux based risk assessment methods are also applied for wheat in India. The stomatal conductance component of this flux method has been parameterised for Indian wheat based on available crop physiology data. Comparisons show that flux based methods tend to estimate larger relative yield losses than concentration based methods (16 % compared to 0.6 to 11.5 % for India). There are also differences in the spatial pattern of estimated risk though both methods clearly identify the Indo-Gangetic Plains as a high O3 risk region. The co-variation in O3 concentrations, crop distribution (both growth periods and geographical location), local meteorology (especially temperature and VPD) and crop physiology are all important in determining flux estimated O3 sensitivity. Finally, the flux based method is used to assess phenological traits (sowing times and maturing periods) introduced in new Indian wheat cultivars. This highlights the importance of crop phenology in determining O3 sensitivity as a function of both O3 concentration and environmental conditions and emphasises the potential application of flux based approaches as a tool capable of informing future crop biotechnology efforts.

 Newborn feeding and infant phenotype	 Gale, Christopher Robert Keith	 Imperial College London	 Imperial College London	2013	Breastfeeding in infancy, when compared with formula feeding, is associated with a reduced incidence of components of the metabolic syndrome later in life. One potential mechanism is via an effect on lipid metabolism and storage, manifesting as altered adiposity and ectopic lipid deposition. I have examined the null hypothesis: no association is detectable between infant feeding and adiposity or ectopic lipid in infancy, through a meta-analysis of published studies and a prospective cohort study of healthy infants employing gold standard direct measurement techniques (magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy). Eleven studies were identified for meta-analysis: in formula-fed compared to breastfed infants, fat mass was lower at 3-4 months [mean difference (95% confidence interval)]: [-0.09 kg (-0.18, -0.01 kg)]	 Thesis or dissertation	 dc_subject:: @@MISSING-DATA	693930	0
 The development of a database and bioinformatics applications for the investigation of immune genes	 Gonzalez Galarza, Faviel	 University of Liverpool	 University of Liverpool	2011	The extensive allelic variability observed in several genes related to the immune response and its significance in transplantation, disease association studies and diversity in human populations has led the scientific community to analyse these variants among individuals. This thesis is focussed on the development of a database and software applications for the investigation of several immune genes and the frequencies of their corresponding alleles in worldwide human populations. The approach presented in this thesis includes the design of a relational database, a web interface, the design of models for data exchange and the development of online searching mechanisms for the analysis of allele, haplotype and genotype frequencies. At present, the database contains data from more than 1000 populations covering more than four million unrelated individuals. The repertory of datasets available in the database encompasses different polymorphic regions such as Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA), Killer-cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIR), Major histocompatibility complex Class I chain-related (MIC) genes and a number of cytokine gene polymorphisms. The work presented in this document has been shown to be a valuable resource for the medical and scientific societies. Acting as a primary source for the consultation of immune gene frequencies in worldwide populations, the database has been widely used in a variety of contexts by scientists, including histocompatibility, immunology, epidemiology, pharmacogenetics and population genetics among many others. In the last year (August 2010 to August 2011), the website was accessed by 15,784 distinct users from 2,758 cities in 136 countries and has been cited in 168 peer-reviewed publications demonstrating its wide international use.

 A case study of the knowledge and understanding of leadership amongst leaders in the Scout Association in an English city	 Kirsz, Alan Stanislaw	 University of Birmingham	 University of Birmingham	2007	Little interest has been shown in the leadership of voluntary providers of informal education for young people. This is true of one of the largest providers: the Scout Association. The thesis examines the nature, diversity and sources of the knowledge and understanding of leadership of Scout Association leaders in one English Midlands city. The understanding is compared with contemporary ways of understanding leadership in education using a typology established by Gunter and Ribbins (2003) and Gunter (2005). The impact of leader training on the understanding of leadership and its perceived effect on leader performance is explored. A case study methodology is used including a questionnaire method supported by documentary evidence and drawing on personal experience. Data analysis involves factor analysis, analysis of variance and Chi-square tests. Findings indicate that leadership is understood in terms of inclusion and success and has an ethical basis pointing to a belief in shared leadership. Variations in this understanding exist amongst different groups. Understanding of leadership mainly comes from sources within the Association. There is a degree of uncertainty amongst leaders about the impact of leader training. Leadership is interpreted in a range of ways as described by the Gunter and Ribbins (2003) and Gunter (2005) typology. The findings could have implications for how the Association develops an understanding of leadership in the future and could influence the thinking and decision making of all leaders in the Association, in particular training managers and trainers from local to national levels of the organisation. The findings may also have implications for researchers interested in the impact of market forces on leadership in the formal education sector.	 Thesis or dissertation	LC5201 Education extension.

 Engaging with the Total oil corporation in Myanmar : the impact of dialogue as a tool for change towards greater conflict sensitivity	 Cerletti, F.	 Coventry University	 Coventry University	2013	This thesis explores whether dialogue between a company and a non-profit organisation (NPO) can influence a company’s way of working towards being more conflict sensitive. As a case-study I analysed the dialogue between the French oil and gas company, Total S.A. (Total), and the US based NPO, CDA Collaborative Learning Projects (CDA) relating to the company’s operations in Myanmar/Burma. The objectives of the research were to ascertain if dialogue had a positive impact, and if so, what it was about the dialogue that enabled change, what was the process of change that could be observed and how embedded such change was. Drawing on post-modernism, systems thinking and complexity thinking, I have built on organisational change, conflict transformation, dialogue and cross-sector partnership literature to examine the role of dialogue as an enabler of change. While highlighting parallels in the discourses, I analyse the process and degree of change within the company through two conflict transformation models, one by Lederach (1997) and the other by Lederach, Neufeld and Culbertson (2007), which I feel best synthesise these parallels. The research is a longitudinal case-study (2002-2012), based on semi-structured interviews and document analysis. The study adds to the limited academic research on conflict sensitivity in general, and on the implications for a company’s way of working in particular. Although I find that within the business sector, the notion of conflict sensitivity is assumed in the wider concept of corporate social responsibility, noteworthy is the relevance of dialogue in change processes. Dialogue is an essential enabler as it sparks transformational levers also recognised in the literature reviewed. However it is not sufficient. The research illustrates that the dialogue between CDA and Total has played a critical role in facilitating a shift in the company’s way of working, with the contribution of other influences at play. As such, I draw attention to the complexity of the change process and discuss the current nature of the drivers of change within Total.

 Polymer bonding by induction heating for microfluidic applications	 Knauf, Benedikt J.	 Loughborough University	 Loughborough University	2010	 Microfluidic systems are being used in more and more areas and the demand for such systems is growing every day. To meet such high volume market needs, a cheap and rapid method for sealing these microfluidic platforms which is viable for mass manufacture is highly desirable. In this work low frequency induction heating (LFIH) is introduced as the potential basis of a cost-effective, rapid production method for polymer microfluidic device sealing. Thin metal layers or structured metal features are introduced between the device s substrates and heated inductively. The surrounding material melts and forms a bond when cooling. During the bonding process it is important to effectively manage the heat dissipation to prevent distortion of the microfluidic platform. The size of the heat affected zone (HAZ), and the area melted, must be controlled to avoid blockage of the microfluidic channels or altering the channels wall characteristics. The effects of susceptor shape and area, bonding pressure, heating time, etc, on the heating rate have been investigated to provide a basis for process optimisation and design rules. It was found that the maximum temperature is proportional to the square of the susceptor area and that round shaped susceptors heat most efficiently. As a result of the investigations higher bonding pressure was identified as increasing bond strength and allowing the reduction of heating time and thus the reduction of melt zone width. The use of heating pulses instead of continuous heating also reduced the dimensions of melt zones while maintaining good bond strength. The size of the HAZ was found to be negligible. An analytical model, which can be used to predict the heating rate, was derived. In validating the model by numeric models and experiments it was found that it cannot be used to calculate exact temperatures but it does correctly describe the effect of different heating parameters. Over the temperature range needed to bond polymer substrates, cooling effects were found not to have a significant impact on the heating rate. The two susceptor concepts using thin metal layers (metal-plastic bonds) or structured metal features (plastic-plastic bonds) were tested and compared. While the metal-plastic bonds turned out to be too weak to be useful, the bonds formed using structured susceptors showed good strength and high leakage pressure. Based on the knowledge gained during the investigations a microfluidic device was designed. Different samples were manufactured and tested. During the tests minor leaks were observed but it was found that this was mainly due to debris which occurred during laser machining of the channels. It was concluded that induction bonding can be used to seal plastic microfluidic devices. The following guidelines can be drawn up for the design of susceptors and process optimisation: Materials with low resistivity perform better; For very thin susceptors the effect of permeability on the heating rate is negligible; The cross-sectional area of the susceptor should be as large as possible to reduce resistance; The thickness of the susceptor should be of similar dimensions to the penetration depth or smaller to increase homogeneity of heat dissipation; The shape of the susceptor should follow the shape of the inductor coil, or vice-versa, to increase homogeneity of heat dissipation; The susceptor should form a closed circuit; Higher bonding pressure leads to stronger bonds and allows reduced heating times; Pulsed heating performs better than continuous heating in terms of limited melt area and good bond strength. The drawbacks of the technique are explained as well: introducing additional materials leads to additional process steps. Also the structuring and placement of the susceptor was identified to be problematic. In this project the structured susceptor was placed manually but that is not feasible for mass manufacture. To be able to use the technique efficiently a concept of manufacturing the susceptor has to be found to allow precise alignment of complex designs.

 Sex offender assessment and treatment: one size fits all?	 Gray, Rosemary	 University of Nottingham	 University of Nottingham	2013	This thesis aimed to explore assessment and treatment issues amongst underresearched groups of sexual offenders. Chapter One sets the context for the thesis. Chapter Two includes a critical appraisal of a widely used risk assessment tool (Risk Matrix 2000), including its validity with groups such as sexual offenders with intellectual disabilities (ID) and internet offenders. Chapter Three details the results of an empirical study which sought to explore the prevalence, characteristics and static risk factors for sexual offenders with ID, with and without a history of non-sexual violence (N=54). The former group were more likely to evidence antisocial features (prior condition failures and previous non-sexual/non-violent offences); whereas the latter group were more likely to have committed a sexual offence against a male victim. Amongst a subgroup (n=32), one quarter committed a further sexual offence over a mean follow-up period of four years. Failure to complete treatment was associated with sexual recidivism. Over one quarter committed a violent offence and other ·1 non-sexual offence. Age at referral was associated with these types of oj recidivism. History of violence was unrelated to all types of recidivism. Chapter Four includes a systematic review of primary research studies that have investigated dynamic risk factors for sexual offenders with ID (N=214). The results suggested that sexual offenders with ID are more likely to hold offence supportive attitudes, and may not utilise sources of social support as effectively as other men with ID. A case study of an internet offender is presented in Chapter Five. Current issues in the assessment and treatment of this group are also critically explored. Chapter Six considers practice implications, thesis limitations and future research directions.	 Thesis or dissertation	364.3	606575	0

 Functional analyses of novel insect virus IRES elements	 Groppelli, Elisabetta	 University of Surrey	 Surrey University	2007	Rhopalosiphum padi virus (RhPV) is a member of the Dicistroviridae. The genomes of these viruses contain two open reading frames, each preceded by distinct internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements. The activity of the RhPV 5' IRES element has previously been demonstrated in mammalian, insect and plant translation systems. It has also been shown that the RhPV 5' IRES forms 48S initiation complexes in vitro with just the mammalian initiation factors eIF2, eIF3 and elFl. It is also possible to delete large regions of the 5' IRES without affecting initiation complex formation. We have now defined the minimal sequences required for directing internal initiation in mammalian, plant and insect translation systems.	 Thesis or dissertation	579.2	499410	0

 Multiprocessing neural network simulator	 Kulakov, Anton	 University of Southampton	 University of Southampton	2013	 Over the last few years tremendous progress has been made in neuroscience by employing simulation tools for investigating neural network behaviour. Many simulators have been created during last few decades, and their number and set of features continually grows due to persistent interest from groups of researchers and engineers. A simulation software that is able to simulate a large-scale neural network has been developed and presented in this work. Based on a highly abstract integrate-and-fire neuron model a clock-driven sequential simulator has been developed in C++. The created program is able to associate the input patterns with the output patterns. The novel biologically plausible learning mechanism uses Long Term Potentiation and Long Term Depression to change the strength of the connections between the neurons based on a global binary feedback. Later, the sequentially executed model has been extended to a multi-processor system, which executes the described learning algorithm using the event-driven technique on a parallel distributed framework, simulating a neural network asynchronously. This allows the simulation to manage larger scale neural networks being immune to processor failure and communication problems. The multi-processor neural network simulator has been created, the main benefit of which is the possibility to simulate large scale neural networks using high-parallel distributed computing. For that reason the design of the simulator has been implemented considering an efficient weight-adjusting algorithm and an efficient way for asynchronous local communication between processors.

 Single-thruster attitude control algorithms for prolate spin-stabilised spacecraft	 Raus, Robin	 University of Surrey	 University of Surrey	2013	 In the field of attitude dynamics and control, passive spacecraft attitude control by spin-stabilisation can already be considered a venerable technique, almost as old as spaceflight itself thanks to its simplicity. Even today it is still used in a variety of missions, ranging from stabilisation during an orbit boost, e.g. the deployment of the first two Galileo IOV spacecraft, to deep-space astronomy, e.g. the Planck space telescope. Mission concepts have been proposed for spin-stabilised penetrator-like spacecraft targeting non-atmospheric celestial bodies such as the Moon, in the Japanese Lunar-A and the British MoonLITE mission proposals, or Jupiter's Galilean moon Europa in the joint NASA-ESA Europa-Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) proposal, which has recently been extensively remodelled to the mainly European Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE). However, the same gyroscopic stability that resists unwanted disturbance torques also has an impact on the commanded manoeuvres. Several techniques have been developed to take into account and whenever possible benefit from the gyroscopic phenomena exhibited by a spinning spacecraft. This thesis will give an overview of the PhD project on single-thruster attitude control of a prolate axisymmetric spacecraft, spin-stabilised around its minimum moment of inertia axis. Having only one attitude thruster on a spinning spacecraft could be preferred for spacecraft simplicity (less mass, less power consumption etc.), or it could be imposed in case of e.g. contingency operations. First of all, the current state-of-the-art slew algorithms Halfcone, Multi-cone, Rhumb Line and the newer Astrium algorithm Sector-Arc Slew have been investigated and qualified. Next, two novel slew algorithms have been identified and developed. One of these is the Extended Halfcone, based on previous sse work. As the name implies, its intention is to extend the usual Half-cone slew algorithm with a mild form of error correction. Another novel algorithm, the Dual-cone slew was designed to overcome the Half-cone limitations regarding attainable slew angles. It is capable of reaching almost any slew angle using two Half-conesj its energy and time consumption performance is comparable to a Multi-cone slew. The conclusion of this section is that there is not a single 'best' slew manoeuvre for all situations.	 Thesis or dissertation	629.41	590662	0

 Combustor and turbine aerothermal interactions in gas turbines with can combustors	 Aslanidou, Ioanna	 University of Oxford	 University of Oxford	2015	 As the research into the improvement of gas turbine performance progresses, the combustor-turbine interface becomes of increasing importance. In new engine designs components come closer together and the study of the combustor and turbine interactions can prove to be valuable for the improvement of the aerothermal performance of the vane. This thesis presents an experimental and numerical investigation of the aerodynamic and heat transfer aspect of the interactions between the combustor and the nozzle guide vane. In the gas turbine studied the trailing edge of the combustor transition duct wall is found upstream of every second vane. In the experimental measurements carried out in a purpose-built high speed experimental facility, the wake of this wall is shown to increase the aerodynamic loss of the vane. On the other hand, the wall alters secondary flow structures and has a protective effect on the heat transfer in the leading edge-endwall junction, a region that has proven to be detrimental to component life. The effect of different clocking positions of the vane relative to the combustor wall are tested experimentally and shown to alter the aerodynamic field and the heat transfer to the vane. The experimental methods and processing techniques adopted in this work are utilized to highlight the differences between the different cases studied. A new concept of using the combustor wall to shield the nozzle guide vane leading edge is introduced, followed by a proposed design that is numerically analysed, including a new cooling system. This uses continuous cooling slots on the upstream combustor wall to cool the vane leading edge. Coolant to the endwalls is provided from continuous slots on the combustor-turbine interface. The reduction of secondary flow through the removal of the horseshoe vortex in the new design results in improved cooling of the endwalls, with a higher average adiabatic effectiveness than in the original case, using the same coolant mass flow rate. The vane surface and suction side are also successfully cooled using less air than that required for a showerhead. The new vane is tested in the experimental facility. The improved aerodynamic and thermal performance of the shielded vane is demonstrated under engine-representative inlet conditions. The new design is shown to have a lower average total pressure loss than the original vane for all inlet conditions. The heat transfer on the vane surface is overall reduced for all inlet conditions and the peak heat transfer on the vane leading edge-endwall junction is moved further upstream, to a region that can be effectively cooled from the upstream cooling slots on the combustor wall trailing edge and the endwalls.

 Menadione resistance : a model for cellular defences against oxidative stress	 Vallis, Katherine Anne	 University of Edinburgh	 University of Edinburgh	1995	 To study the genetic changes which confer resistance to oxidants, cell lines that are resistant to the redox-cycling agent, menadione, have been isolated from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and human transitional carcinoma (EJ) parental cell lines. They exhibit cross-resistance to chemical oxidants (hydrogen peroxide and sodium arsenite) but not to ionising radiation (in oxic conditions). The concentrations of the major sources of intracellular thiol groups, glutathione and cysteine, are two-fold greater in menadione-resistant than in the corresponding parental cell lines. Exposure to menadione results in depletion of both glutathione and cysteine but the subsequent recovery of thiols is more rapid and of greater magnitude in menadione-resistant than sensitive cell lines.

 Transition metal catalysts for the controlled radical polymerisation of vinyl monomers	 Zanetti, Paola C.	 Imperial College London	 Imperial College London	2009	The research described in this thesis concerns the synthesis of transition metal coordination complexes and their activity in the controlled radical polymerisation (CRP) of styrene, methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate. In the first, introductory chapter, the literature pertaining to the main reported CRP systems is reviewed. The second chapter focuses on a family of novel α-diimine Fe(II) complexes bearing a conjugated acenaphthene backbone. The ligand-dependent catalytic behaviour in the atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP) of styrene is discussed, and the reaction conditions are varied to shed light on the system features. In the Chapter 3 the synthesis, characterisation and screening for reverse ATRP of the Fe(III) trichloride derivatives, as well as of two monodentate imino Fe(III) trichloride complexes, are described. A relationship between measured spin state and catalytic behaviour is highlighted. The fourth chapter reports the synthesis of bis-salicylaldimino Cr(II) complexes and their activity in the controlled radical polymerisation of styrene and vinyl acetate. The observed rearrangement of the latter monomer in the presence of chromium complexes is also examined. The fifth and final experimental chapter extends the studies carried out on bissalicylaldimino Cr(II) complexes to other transition metals, namely iron and cobalt. Chapter 6 gives the experimental details for Chapters 2-4. Crystallographic data for all X-ray diffraction structures presented in this thesis are collated in Chapter 7.

 Electric transport measurements of thin film high-Tc superconductor bicrystal grain boundary Josephson junctions	 John, Daniel	 Loughborough University	 Loughborough University	2014	Josephson junctions are an integral component of superconducting electronics because of their non-linear response and have not only been incorporated into a number of devices including superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) to create highly sensitive magnetometers and Josephson flux vortex transistors (JVFTs) to make fast-switching, high gain transistors but also into experiments to resolve the unexplained pairing mechanisms in high-Tc superconductors. As such, chapter 2 describes the results of an investigation into the pairing mechanism of the infinite layer superconductor Sr1-xLaxCuO2 using a single Josephson junction. The main result of this was that observations of zero bias conductance peaks (ZBCP) strongly suggest that SLCO superconductors are d-wave superconductors. This also contradicts many previous reports which concluded that SLCO superconductors are s-wave superconductors. Chapter 3 describes the results of measurements of YBa2Cu3O7-δ Josephson junction arrays. The results of this showed that the device had periodical behaviour at temperatures close to Tc with a periodicity of 1.8 mA or 12 μT. Moreover, it was found that this device could also operate as a Josephson vortex flow transistor (JVFT) which produced gains as high as 19.28 ± 0.03 at 77 K. In addition, switching behaviour was also found. Therefore, the record high current gains found at 77 K and above, as well as the switching behaviour make this device highly suitable for applications as a superconducting transistor.

 Voice and young people in State care in Ireland	 Glynn, Carole	 University of South Wales	 University of South Wales	2016	Human rights progressed significantly during the latter half of the 20th century; however their development is challenged in the early 21st century as issues of global economic, political and financial concern dominate international agendas. In Ireland, children's rights have been particularly slow to progress, experiencing a 20 year delay between the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1992 and the referendum to enable its Articles in 2012. This research is motivated by that referendum, in examining how the child's right to voice has been implemented for those in State care as of 2016. The study evaluates the extent of voice for those young people and identifies what voice means in this context. The research contributes to an expansion of existing knowledge regarding participation through voice, by considering the experience of vulnerable service users who need support in a service prescribed by statute. It also highlights the current gaps in realising the right to voice for those in care, which is of social and cultural significance. Lastly the study is of value to the service provider, who is responsible for ensuring that all the young people in care are afforded opportunities to exercise their right to voice.

 Swan-plant interactions in a chalk river catchment	 Wood, K. A.	 Bournemouth University	 Bournemouth University	2012	Plants are of fundamental importance to the structure, functioning and service provision of many ecosystems. However, herbivores can have negative ecological and socioeconomic effects on plant communities through consumption, trampling and alteration of nutrient cycles. In this thesis I address a particular herbivore-plant interaction: the grazing of plants in chalk river catchments, principally the submerged macrophyte water crowfoot (Ranunculus penicillatus ssp. pseudofluitans (Syne) S.D. Webster) and terrestrial pasture grass species, by flocks of non-breeding mute swans (Cygnus olor Gmelin, 1789). This research was carried out over two years in the River Frome catchment (Dorset, UK). Based on a meta-analysis of previous waterfowl grazing studies I show that waterfowl biomass density (kg ha-1) rather than individual density (ind. ha-1) is a better predictor of reductions in plant standing crop. Most studies to date have analysed such reductions using only individual densities, despite large between-taxa variation in waterfowl body mass, diet and intake rates. I quantified the abundance, species richness, evenness, flowering and dominance of the chalk river aquatic plant community in relation to biotic and abiotic factors during the growth-, peak-, and recession-phases of the growth cycle. The relative importance of herbivory, riparian shading, water temperature and distance downstream varied between different phases of the plant growth cycle, highlighting the importance of seasonal patterns in regulation of plant community structure. The River Frome swan population varied seasonally, being highest in the winter. The population was dominated by non-breeding adults and juveniles that lived in flocks. These flocks exhibited strong seasonal habitat switches between terrestrial pasture in winter and spring, and river in summer and autumn. I provided evidence that this switch was linked to the seasonal decrease in water velocity between spring and summer, which reduced the metabolic costs of river feeding and increased the relative profitability of aquatic food resources. I used a mathematical population model and an individual-based behavioural model respectively to explore two management options for the alleviation of the swan grazing conflict in chalk rivers: population control and habitat alterations. Population control measures, such as clutch manipulations, fertility control, culling or translocations, were predicted to be unsuccessful except at impractically high levels of management effort, due to the effects of immigration and high survival rates in offsetting removed eggs or individuals. Habitat alterations, in particular the narrowing of river channels to cause a local increase in water velocity and thus swan foraging costs, are more promising management options as they require lower management effort, are less ethically controversial, and address the fundamental reason why swans select their food resources, the rate of net energy gain (‘profitability’).

 A comparative study of selected aspects of law of servitudes in Scotland, South Africa and Sri Lanka	 Perera, Anusha S.	 University of Aberdeen	 University of Aberdeen	2010	 One explanation for the poor development of the law of servitude in Sri Lanka is that it is based on Roman and Roman-Dutch law which are stagnant systems and hence contributes to the Sri Lankan law of servitude being a fossil law.  The aim of this study is to examine whether the law of servitudes is truly a law which cannot be developed according to the needs of the society and, if so, whether the reason for this is that this area is mainly governed by the principles of Roman and Roman-Dutch law. This question was explored by researching the way this area of law has been developed in two other similar jurisdictions: Scotland and South Africa.  The similarities between these systems are that these jurisdictions are mixed legal systems and that the law of property and especially the law of servitudes have been substantially influenced by and mainly governed by Roman and Roman-Dutch law principles of the law of servitudes adopted in the courts and supplemented by the legislature of these jurisdictions.  Aspects such as: the importance of the requirement that there must be a dominant tenement for the creation of servitudes; the applicability of the principle of 	 Thesis or dissertation	 Servitudes	531897	0

 Learning your way out? : a sociology of working class educational experience	 Roberts, William	 University of Bath	 University of Bath	2012	This study examines the intersections of class, social exclusion and education policy during New Labour’s time in office, with the bulk of its focus falling upon secondary schooling. Working against wider political, academic and popular effacements and recodifications of class, and with a particular focus upon its marginalisation within both political and academic discourses of social exclusion, both concepts are mapped out in ways which allow them to be understood in tandem and as rooted within the structures, processes and relations of society and its constitutive institutions. Qualitative in approach, and set within the ebb and flow of long running educational struggles heavily imbued with issues of class, the study uses semistructured interviews with 21 education professionals to explore the impact of the current market-based education policy regime upon the institutional structures, processes and professional practices which confront working class pupils on a daily basis. In turn, it examines the ways in which working class pupils and the shaping of their educational experiences are understood by those trained and charged to teach in an education system intimately bound to the re/production of class inequalities and social exclusion. Parallel to this, the project uses biographically orientated interviews with 17 working class young people in order to explore the variegated ways in which class and social exclusion intersect within their schooling careers as they are shaped along shifting axes through, within, and against the kinds of contexts and conditions mapped out by education professionals. The study provides key insights into the contemporary circulation of class within schools: invoked through crosscutting narratives of ‘ability’, ‘deficiency’ and ‘social constructivism’ by education professionals caught within systemic pressures to perform, and a ubiquitous facet of working class educational experience which is continually stirring, settling, straining to be re/made, and wrought through shifting layers and dimensions of in/exclusion.

 Linguistic diversity in Negara Brunei Darussalam : an ecological perspective	 Haji-Othman, Noor Azam	 University of Leicester	 University of Leicester	2005	 Despite its tiny size and population, Brunei Darussalam is linguistically and ethnically diverse. The dominant race, the Malays, is made up of seven different ethnic groups, namely Belait, Bisaya, Brunei Malays, Dusun, Kedayan, Murut and Tutong, all of whom are considered indigenous to Brunei. With the exception of the Brunei Malays and Kedayans, each of the other groups traditionally speaks their own distinct indigenous languages that are distinct from the Malay language. Drawing on qualitative data obtained through interviews and documentary analysis, this study aims to explore the historical and contemporary interrelationships between these languages within the 'ecology of language' framework, and to find out how the notion of linguistic diversity interplays with national unity in the face of modernization. Although the study reveals a high level of tolerance by the informants toward linguistic diversity, there is evidence to suggest that as the minority ethnic population are abandoning their traditional languages and shifting to Malay, a synchronous convergent evolutionary process of identity shift is occurring too. The implications are that as linguistic diversity is diminishing in Brunei, so too is cultural diversity.	 Thesis or dissertation	305.7095955	422923	0

 The Piercebridge formula in the North-East of England : an assessment and alternative method of supply to the Roman army	 Anderson, James Donald	 University of Newcastle upon Tyne	 Newcastle University	1991	This thesis tests a recent theory of Roman military supply in the North-east of England. The Piercebridge formula (Selkirk, 1983) involves a system of Roman forts provisioned by barges along rivers made navigable by a series of dams, locks and canals. The formula is first assessed on a theoretical basis: as a comprehensive road system was built across Britain during the Conquest period, construction of Piercebridge formula components for river-borne fort supply would have been justified only if the Piercebridge formula was significantly more efficient than overland transport. To this end, the efficiency of Piercebridge formula river-borne fort supply vis-a-vis the efficiency of overland fort supply is assessed in a survey area comprising the North-east of England. Evidence for the Iformulal is then assessed at ten sites across the North-east. A second aim of this thesis is to present an alternative to the Piercebridge formula method of supply to forts in the North-east. This alternative method involves sea-borne transport to ports serving the North-eastr overland transport by ox-cart and pack animals along the Roman as well as native road systems, and river transport upon barges and other craft when such rivers were naturally navigable.

 The anti-inflammatory action of tetracyclines	 Dunston, Christopher R.	 Aston University	 Aston University	2008	For six decades tetracyclines have been successfully used for their broad spectrum antibiotic effects. However, non-antibiotic effects of tetracyclines have been reported. The anti-inflammatory effects of tetracycline drugs have been investigated in the context of a range of inflammatory diseases including sepsis and a number of neurodegenerative diseases. This thesis investigates the effects of a range of clinically important tetracyclines (oxytetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline and tigecycline) on the ability of the J774.2 cell line to produce nitric oxide when stimulated with the bacterial cell wall component, LPS.

 Investigating the mechanisms of telomeric mutation in human cells	 Alotibi, Raniah Saleem	 Cardiff University	 Cardiff University	2015	Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures that contain non-coding (TTAGGG) tandem repeats and associated telomere binding proteins at the end of chromosomes. As a consequence of end-replication losses, telomeres undergo gradual erosion with ongoing cell division. It is hypothesised that in addition to the end-replication problem, mutational mechanisms may contribute to telomere erosion by generating large-scale telomeric deletion events. As short dysfunctional telomeres are capable of fusion to other chromosome ends, large-scale telomeric deletions can lead to genomic instability which in turn may drive tumour progression. The primary aim of this thesis was to investigate putative mutational mechanisms that could lead to large-scale telomeric deletion. The role of oxidative stress and it potential contribution to telomere dynamics was assessed. The induction of fragility and replication inhibition at telomeres was also examined. Furthermore, the role that G-quadruplex structure within telomere repeat sequences and the possible induction of replication fork stalling and resolution as single or double stranded breaks was also considered as a mutational mechanism that could lead to telomere deletion. High-resolution analysis of telomere dynamics using Single Telomere Length Analysis (STELA), following the induction of oxidative stress in IMR90 fibroblasts, revealed that oxidative damage does not appear to affect the rate of telomere erosion, or the frequency of large-scale telomeric deletion. The data are more consistent with the view that premature senescence does not arise as a consequence of accelerated telomere erosion, but instead more likely results from stochastic DNA damage across the rest of the genome. The analysis of telomere dynamics following the induction of chromosome fragility, showed that telomere length in Seckel cell (SCK) fibroblasts were significantly different from those of untreated cells following treatments with aphidicolin with an increase in stochastic telomeric deletion. Whilst in MRC5 fibroblasts, the induction of the telomere fragility impacted on the upper to lower allele ratio, with a loss of the longer telomere length distributions. The stabilisation of G-quadruplex structures using the G-quadruplex ligand (RHPS4), together with ATRX knockdown, showed that an absence of ATRX sensitised cells to the ligand, but that the stabilisation of G-quadruplexes, did not significantly affect the telomere dynamics as determined using STELA. Taken together, the data presented in this thesis are not consistent with a role for oxidative stress, or the formation of G-quadruplex structures, in generating large-scale telomeric deletion; however telomeric mutational events may occur following the induction of chromosome fragile sites, specifically in the context of an ATR deficiency.

Functional analysis of the Parkinson's disease associated genes, parkin and PINK1, in vitro	 Muqit, M. M. K.	 University College London (University of London)	 UCL (University College London)	2007	Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder. Our understanding of the disease has been enhanced by the discovery of gene mutations in rare families with eariy-onset autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (ARJP). The first gene to be identified was parkin and two further genes have been identified namely, DJ-1 and PINK1. The latter was discovered in our laboratory. The work of this thesis has aimed to increase our understanding of how these newly discovered genes play a role in neuronal survival and how disease-causing mutations result in neurodegenerarJon. Utilising gene transfer techniques and transient and stable cell culture expression systems, the function of parkin and PINK1 was investigated in human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell lines. The work of this thesis has confirmed and extended previous reports that parkin over-expression confers neuroprotection against a variety of cellular stresses implicated in PD. Moreover, this work has showed for the first time that endogenous parkin protein can localize to aggregates known as "aggresomes' following stress and that the formation of these parkin positive aggresomes can be dissociated from parkin's effect on neuronal survival. Furthermore, this work describes the first functional characterization of PINK1. It demonstrates that PINK1 localizes to the mitochondria in neuronal cells where it may play a neuroprotective role against cellular stress. Moreover, this effect is abrogated by disease causing mutations in PINK1. This work also reports on the characterisation of novel PINK1 antibodies and shows for the first time that PINK1 can localize to aggresomes and the mechanism is linked to mitochondrial recruitment. The work of this thesis sheds light on the increasing importance of the ubiquitin proteasome system and mitochondria in the pathogenesis of PD. Improved understanding of these cellular processes should lead to more effective treatments for this devastating disease.	 Thesis or dissertation	 dc_subject:: @@MISSING-DATA	719052	0
